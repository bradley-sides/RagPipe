Certainly! Here’s a chronological timeline of how Opendoor (OPEN) has discussed the impact of housing market cycles—such as rising mortgage rates, supply shortages, and buyer demand—on its pricing, margins, and acquisition strategy, grouped by fiscal quarter and year.

### QQ1 FY2024 (Quarter 1, Fiscal Year 2024: ~May 2024)

- Opendoor noted a recent meaningful spike in mortgage rates coinciding with the peak buying and selling season, acknowledging that such rate increases are factored into their pricing and spread decisions. They adjust spreads upward when anticipating lower post-spring season gains ([OPEN | QQ1 FY2024 • 2024-05-02]).
- The company emphasized that its business model does not rely on buyer agent commissions, and that potential declines in commissions could allow Opendoor to pass savings to consumers via lower spreads, potentially improving conversion and margins ([OPEN | QQ1 FY2024 • 2024-05-02]).

### QQ2 FY2024 (Quarter 2, Fiscal Year 2024: ~August 2024)

- Opendoor observed additional slowing in the housing market in late Q2, with higher delistings, slowing clearance rates, and home price appreciation (HPA) turning negative earlier than usual. In response, they increased spreads more than anticipated and reduced marketing spend to preserve efficiency ([OPEN | QQ2 FY2024 • 2024-08-01]).
- The company enacted larger home-level price drops to maintain resale clearance targets, which impacted contribution margin but was necessary for risk management ([OPEN | QQ2 FY2024 • 2024-08-01]).

- Opendoor maintained flexibility in setting spreads to navigate macro uncertainty, expecting the challenging environment to be temporary but remaining disciplined in cost and operations ([OPEN | QQ2 FY2024 • 2024-08-01]).

### QQ3 FY2024 (Quarter 3, Fiscal Year 2024: ~November 2024)

- Elevated spreads and reduced marketing spend (initiated in late May) were direct responses to deteriorating macro signals, including clearance rates, delistings, and HPA ([OPEN | QQ3 FY2024 • 2024-11-07]).

- The company is aligning its marketing and acquisition strategy to seasonal demand, increasing acquisitions in Q4 and Q1 (to sell into peak demand periods) and scaling back in Q2 and Q3 (when demand and price appreciation are lower) ([OPEN | QQ4 FY2024 • 2025-02-25]).
- Despite elevated spread levels, Opendoor accelerated acquisitions late in the quarter as conversion improved, enabled by product enhancements ([OPEN | QQ4 FY2024 • 2025-02-25]).
- The company completed the separation of Mainstay and took steps to simplify the business, focusing on sustainable, profitable growth ([OPEN | QQ4 FY2024 • 2025-02-25]).

- The company expects a "barbell" seasonal pattern in acquisitions: more homes acquired in Q1 and Q4, fewer in Q2 and Q3, to align with demand and price appreciation cycles ([OPEN | QQ1 FY2025 • 2025-05-06]).
- Homes acquired more recently are starting at higher contribution margin levels, though margins still decay with holding time. The focus remains on efficiency and risk management ([OPEN | QQ1 FY2025 • 2025-05-06]).
- The reduction in marketing spend and focus on margin will pressure top-line revenue in the back half of the year, but the goal is to deliver year-over-year contribution margin improvement ([OPEN | QQ1 FY2025 • 2025-05-06]).
