        - (Represents $20mm YoY improvement at midpoint; first positive quarterly adj. EBITDA in 3 years)
    - Adjusted OpEx: ~$55mm
    - Stock-based compensation: $13mm–$15mm (over 50% decline YoY)
    - Home acquisitions: ~1,700 units
        - Expect slow pace Q2/Q3; ramp in Q4 following seasonal pattern
    - Marketing spend in Q2 to be significantly lower than Q1 (seasonal)

- H2 2025:
    - Expect revenue to decline YoY in Q3/Q4 (due to lower acquisitions)
    - Goal: Deliver YoY contribution margin improvement in Q3/Q4 (operating efficiencies, wider spreads)
    - Adj. net loss for FY2025 expected to improve vs. 2024

- Cost Structure:
    - Cost efficiencies expected to be durable
    - OpEx reductions will persist, but less room for further large cuts

## PRODUCTS / BUSINESS MODEL

- REMIT: Reinvent U.S. residential real estate, emphasizing certainty, convenience, and customer-centricity
- Evolution toward platform for seller choice:
    - Sellers can receive cash offer OR list with agent
    - Platform enables agent to provide certainty via a cash offer
    - Piloting customer referral to vetter partner agents: agent explains options (cash offer, listing, etc.), does in-home assessment, helps conversion, faster offers
    - Agent partnership program operating in 11 pilot markets, asset-light revenue focus
    - Expansion into this agent-enabled model aims to serve more sellers and monetize more of funnel

- Marketplace: Presently paused in expansion (currently only in Dallas, Charlotte, Raleigh); not a focus for near-term growth due to housing market softness

## SUPPLY CHAIN / OPERATIONS

- Pricing strategy:
    - Maintaining pricing discipline amidst volatility
    - Spreads have been proactively increased to protect contribution margin, at expense of acquisition volume growth

- Conversion optimization:
    - Active enhancements to pricing models (e.g., refining spread allocation, more granular price segmentation)
    - Algorithms enhanced in Q1: Added features like school district quality, active competition

- Marketing:
    - Realigned to seasonal housing dynamics → greater spend efficiency
    - Q2 spend to be "meaningfully lower" QoQ; focus on highest ROI channels

- Cost structure:
    - Fixed cost base significantly reduced over past year (33%/~$20mm YoY in Q1)
    - Further opportunities for process efficiency being pursued, but further large cuts less likely

- Inventory management:
    - Q2 2025: Resales to outpace acquisitions, reducing inventory balance and generating favorable OpEx adjustment

## MARKET / CUSTOMER DYNAMICS

- Macro environment:
    - Challenger: Mortgage rates >7%, clearance rates -25% YoY, delistings +30% YoY
    - Consumer sentiment muted, sellers hesitant, increased contract cancellations
    - Macro headwinds expected to persist through near term

- Channel strategy:
    - Increasing share of acquisitions originated by external agents bringing clients for cash offers
    - New: Opendoor now also refers seller leads to vetted partner agents earlier in process (11 pilot markets)
        - Agent partners explain selling options, complete in-home assessment, serve as trusted adviser
        - Aims for higher conversion, asset-light revenue, and improved customer experience

    - "List with Opendoor": Continues as end-of-funnel referral product for DTC leads who want to list with an agent after exploring cash offer
    - Marketplace product on hold due to market softness

## CONTRIBUTION / MARGIN DYNAMICS

- Contribution margin in Q2 2025 expected consistent with Q1 (mid-4% range)
    - Lower than 2024 due to mix (older, lower-margin inventory makes up greater share of Q2 sales; newer cohorts perform well but not enough to offset mix)
    - Longer hold times systematically lead to lower margins; newer acquisitions start at higher margin and decay over time

- Spreads:
    - Elevated spreads (pricing in greater market risk)
    - Higher spreads support margin, but reduce acquisition volume

## LEADERSHIP

- Carrie Wheeler, CEO: Emphasized focus on profitability, expanding platform/channel strategy, and agent partnerships
- Selim Freiha, CFO: Focused on efficiency, cost discipline, balance sheet strength, and prudent pace of acquisitions

## CATALYSTS

- Return to positive adj. EBITDA projected in Q2 2025 (first time in >3 years)
- Agent-based channel expansion (pilot programs across 11 markets); could increase conversion, asset-light revenue, and overall funnel monetization if positive signals continue
- Durable cost structure improvements enable reduced losses, even if macro remains soft
- Asset-light revenue streams to grow as agent channel becomes more prominent
