Ryan Taylor
Our first quarter of the year showcased incredible strength and remarkable momentum as revenue grew 39% year-over-year .
Our story continues to be one of preeminence in the U.S.
Our U.S. revenue grew 55% year-over-year and now makes up 71% of our overall business.
Our U.S. commercial businesses extraordinary momentum continued as revenue grew 71% year-over-year .
Our foundational U.S. government business achieved compelling revenue growth of 45% year-over-year .
Our results continue to redefine the Rule of 40 with our Rule of 40 score increasing from 81 in Q4 to 83 last quarter .
While organizations may consider curtailing spending to drive ef ficiencies or weather heightened volatility , they find this is the moment they need Palantir
the most. The time they turn to us asking how can we help them adapt and solve their latest challenges.
As AI models progress and improve, we continue enabling our customers to maximally leverage these models in production, capitalizing upon the rich
context within the enterprise through the Ontology . We remain dif ferentiated in our elite execution to deliver quantified exceptionalism for our customers,
ever widening their advantage over the AI have-nots.
As a result, unrelenting demand for AIP continues to drive outperformance despite Q1 historically being our slowest quarter due to business seasonality .
Our U.S. commercial revenue grew 19% sequentially to surpass the $1 billion annual run rate for revenue in Q1. W e closed $810 million in U.S.
commercial TCV with a 239% year-over-year growth rate on a dollar-weighted duration basis, and we closed twice as many deals of $1 million or more
compared to the same time period a year ago. I feel the demand in the conversations I'm having with customers.
On the ground, things are accelerating. Customers are getting started then expanding in quick succession. A large health care company did a boot camp
with us in December and 5 weeks later converted to a 5-year $26 million ACV enterprise agreement.
Print
A global bank started a pilot with us in Q4 2024, signed a $2 million engagement a month later then expanded to a 3-year $19 million ACV engagement 4
months after that. A Fortune 500 health care company began working with us in Q2 2024 and last quarter , signed a 5-year $10 million ACV conversion
deal. The pace and magnitude of these deals are being driven by the quantified exceptionalism our customers received from day 1 working with us.
We continue to hear from customers that our software's impact is remarkably apparent. A Walgreens executive recently highlighted Foundry and AIP
allowed them to play AI-powered end-to-end workflows in 4,000 stores within 8 months, automating what would have amounted to 384 billion decisions
every day if relying on humans. AIG recently highlighted that they expect the end-to-end adoption of tech advancements leveraging Palantir will double
their 5-year CAGR. They noted, "It's an unbelievable outcome in terms of what we get.
You could give underwriters unlimited time, 2, 3, 4 weeks. They still can't get the amount of data that I can get within 2 to 3 hours through Palantir ." We are
partnering with R1 RCM to develop intelligent automation solutions to create faster , more precise health care reimbursement outcomes.
Their executive noted, "we believe there's a multi-$100 billion opportunity here industry-wide to put money back into the pockets of providers and
physicians so they can better invest in patient outcomes." Our name is popping up across earnings calls around the world as companies like Citibank, BP
and L3Harris tout the ambition of their work with Palantir to their investors.
Our U.S. government business continues to achieve impressive growth as we deliver towards the vital missions of the agencies we support.
As the government focuses on ef ficiency , our commercially fielded, battle hardened products stand-alone.
Last quarter , we closed deals expanding our work in the Department of Defense, including the critical impact we are delivering with Maven Smart System
across the CoCom and the services. The impact is far reaching. Internationally , we closed a deal to provide Palantir Maven Smart System to NA TO to
deploy our AI Mission Command solution across its 32 member states. Historically , in periods of turmoil organizations, both public and private, have turned
to Palantir .
With the proliferation of AI, you see an even wider gap between the winners and losers. The winners won't be determined by size, but by adaptability .
Many organizations are having to reimagine how their business does and should work in the future simply to survive.
We are built to help companies embrace volatility .
We expect more surprises, not less. And with the uncertainty ahead, we are more confident than ever in Palantir's ability to deliver tangible impact for our
customers to transform organizations with real workflows in production and to help institutions adapt to survive.
I'll now turn it over to Shyam.
Shyam Sankar
Thanks, Ryan. W e've been consistently saying that even while the LOMs are improving, the models across both closed and open source, they're
becoming more similar and that performance will converge, all while cost per token for inference continues to drop substantially . The market has been
focused on AI supply , the models, while we have been focused on delivering on AI demand. It's now blindingly obvious to everyone after the first
DeepSeek moment.
Our foundational investments in Ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and into the world ahead. AIP has
entered the next phase of product development and adoption focused on enterprise autonomy .
As I mentioned last call, the normative value of AI is the self-driving company . We're not talking about copilots that make you 50% more productive, we're
talking about agents that make you 50x more productive.
AIP is increasingly owning the position of being the technology that translate the ever-expanding raw capability of LLM into business outcomes through
oncology . AIP is proving to be the best harness to build, test, evaluate and deploy agents to eat the elephant of the enterprise. Everyday users are building
their own agents to realize the potential of enterprise autonomy across both public and private sector . AI agents are operating as part of human AI teams,
leveraging the mix of workflow applications for mammals and code-first approaches for AI agents with Ontology as that common intermediary
representation of the state of the enterprise. Agents are having a transformative impact for our customers now from targeting our enemies to targeting
supply chain opportunities.
You can hear more about these stories, not in our earnings call, but as Ryan mentioned, in our customers' earnings calls, AIG, City , BP, L3Harris, Hertz all
mentioned the transformative impact of AIP on their most recent calls. These agents represent AI users, the supply chain agent that works with your
supply chain analysts, the intelligence AI agent that works with your human agents. AI as a platform enables our customers to rapidly build and deploy AI
agents that automate more and more of the enterprise in a continuous fashion.
AIG announced the AI underwriting agent. AI agents are processing vast volumes of intelligence reports in the Department of Defense, finding things
humans missed. AI agents are monitoring for sepsis at Tampa General.
As Ryan mentioned, our U.S. business is on fire. And I want to, again, call out the continued strength, with W arp Speed in particular , our modern American
manufacturing operating system. Both the adoption and the rate of product development has exceeded expectations. These investments are powering
America's reindustrialization, not only with new defense entrants, but also with traditional defense industrial players and the broader manufacturing
industry .
Turning to government. W e delivered our first Titan vehicles to the U.S. Army in Q1, on time, on budget. The army rate of Titan as a top-performing
program. And everything about it is heretical, a military vehicle with a software company as the prime contractor , and it's built by a team of nontraditional
defense innovators like [indiscernible]. Maven Smart System adoption continues to grow , with usage doubling in the first 9 months of 2024 and doubling
again in the 5 subsequent months. The rate of adoption has really accelerated as Maven scales across more combatant commands and through the
services and into more and more use cases.
You commonly hear combatant commanders reference Maven in their posture hearings to Congress now . And Maven has reached Europe, with NA TO
adopting the capabilities of Maven Smart System as its C2 operating system. Leadership at uComm said, "this platform, Maven, has become more than a
common operating picture, it's a decision advantage environment that is rapidly transforming the command." AI agents aren't just transforming the U.S.
commercial sector , they are transforming how we fight. AI agents are analyzing intelligence, finding targets, automating staf f functions and improving the
understanding of the battle space. But we are just at the beginning.
Our defense users are amongst the most creative and self-suf ficient developers. Green suiters developed the Hurricane Helene Rescue common
operating picture in 5 days.
Next time, they will have AI agents do it for them in 5 minutes.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.
David Glazer
Thanks, Shyam. W e had an exceptional first quarter . Revenue growth accelerated to 39% year-over-year , exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by
nearly 350 basis points and representing an 1,800 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q1 of last year . We achieved another $1 billion
milestone this quarter by surpassing $1 billion annual run rate in our U.S. commercial business for the first time, which grew 71% year-over-year and 19%
sequentially .
On the back of this continued strength, we are raising our full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint to $3.896 billion, representing a 36% year-over-year
growth rate and our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.178 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 68%. The continued increase
in demand for AIP drove the outperformance in your U.S. business overall in the first quarter , which grew 55% year-over-year and 13% sequentially ,
including our U.S. government business, which grew 45% year-over-year and 9% sequentially .
We delivered these outstanding top line results at an adjusted operating margin of 44%, representing an 800 basis point increase compared to the first
quarter of last year .
Our revenue and profitability drove a 2-point sequential increase to a Rule of 40 score from 81 in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 83 in the first quarter of
2025.
We also had a strong cash flow quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $370 million, representing a margin of 42%.
Turning to our global top line results.
First quarter revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $884 million.
First quarter U.S. revenue grew 55% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to $628 million.
Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter revenue grew 44% year-over-year and 7% sequentially , and first quarter
U.S. revenue grew 56% year-over-year and 14% sequentially . Customer count grew 39% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to 769 customers. Revenue
from our largest customers continues to expand.
First quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 26% year-over-year to $70 million per customer .
Now moving to our commercial segment.
First quarter commercial revenue grew 33% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $397 million.
Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter commercial revenue grew 42% year-over-year and 8% sequentially . We closed
$930 million in commercial TCV bookings, representing 84% growth year-over-year .
As I highlighted earlier , we achieved a $1 billion annual run rate in our U.S. commercial business for the first time as AIP continues to drive both new
customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S.
First quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 71% year-over-year and 19% sequentially to $255 million.
Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 75% year-over-year and 22% sequentially .
We are the strongest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV booked at $810 million, representing growth of 183% year-over-year . On a trailing 12-month basis,
we closed over $2 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings highlighting the demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S.
commercial business grew 127% year-over-year and 30% sequentially .
Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 432 customers reflecting growth of 65% year-over-year and 13% sequentially .
First quarter international commercial revenue declined 5% year-over-year and 1 1% sequentially to $141 million. The decline was driven by continued
headwinds in Europe and by the onetime revenue catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2024 that we noted on last quarter's call.
For our international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond, but remain
focused on accelerating the growth in our U.S. business.
Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $5.1 million for the quarter . We anticipate second quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to be
between $4 million to $6 million compared to $9 million in the second quarter of 2024. W e anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to continue to be
approximately 0.5 of 1% of full year revenue.
Shifting to our Government segment.
First quarter government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $487 million.
First quarter U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $373 million. This growth was driven by continued execution in
existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI and our government software of ferings.
First quarter international government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $1 14 million, bolstered by our continued work in U.K.
health care and defense as well as our new partnership with NA TO.
First quarter TCV booked was $1.5 billion, up 66% year-over-year . Net dollar retention was 124%, an increase of 400 basis points from last quarter . The
increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q1 of last year as we see the ef fect of the AI revolution.
As net dollar retention does not include revenue from the new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it has not yet fully captured the
acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year . We ended the first quarter with $5.97 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of
45% year-over-year and 10% sequentially and $1.9 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 46% year-over-year and 10% sequentially .
As a reminder , RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12
months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.
Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 82% for the quarter . Adjusted income
from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, and related employer payroll taxes was $391 million, representing adjusted
operating margin of 44%. Q1 adjusted expense was $493 million, up 8% sequentially and 21% year-over-year , primarily driven by our continued
investment in AIP and technical hiring.
We continue to expect to see a more significant increase in expense in 2025 as we invest in the most elite technical talent, the product pipeline and AI
production use cases, all delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP  profitability .
First quarter GAAP  operating income was $176 million, representing a 20% margin.
First quarter GAAP  net income was $214 million, representing a 24% margin.
First quarter stock-based compensation expense was $155 million and employee-related equity tax expense was $59 million.
First quarter GAAP  earnings per share was $0.08.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.13.
Additionally , our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 83% in the first quarter , a 2-point increase to our Rule of 40
score from the prior quarter on our 7th consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score.
With the increase in our 2025 revenue and adjusted operating income guidance, we are now guiding to a Rule of 40 score of 80 for the full year .
Turning to our cash flow . In the first quarter , we generated $310 million in cash from operations and $370 million in adjusted free cash flow , representing
margins of 35% and 42%, respectively . Through the end of the first quarter , we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares as part of our share
repurchase program.
As of the end of the quarter , we have $918 million remaining of the original authorization. W e ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents
and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.
Now turning to our outlook.
For Q2 2025, we expect revenue of between $934 million and $938 million, adjusted income from operations of between $401 million and $405 million.
For full year 2025, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $3.89 billion and $3.902 billion, we are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance
to an excess of $1.178 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 68%.
We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $1.71 1 billion and $1.723 billion. W e're raising our adjusted free cash flow
guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP  operating income and net income in each quarter of this year . With
that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick of f the Q&A.
Alexander Karp
Welcome to our earnings adventure. Palantir is on fire. W e -- there's been a lot of discussions basically how we should talk about these numbers and
people admonishing me to be a little more modest. And we'll try . It's the reality of what's going on is that this is an unvarnished concafeny of of the
combination of 20 years of investment and a massive cultural shift in the U.S. which is generating numbers, again, 71% growth in U.S. commercial, 71%.
We had journalists this morning that were asking me if it's a 7 handle, a 71% growth, we had 45% growth in our U.S. government business. Every 3 days,
you read a headline about how our commercial business would be in danger because of pressure -- necessary pressure put on the system to root out
fraud waste and abuse and to pentest systems to see if they create more value or much more value or less value or no value in the U.S. government.
We are seeing rapid expansion and very significant demand for Maven, both in America and outside of America as all part of our core mission to provide
an unfair advantage to the Noble warriors of the W est.
We see an increased recognition that large language models were commodities that the value of these commodities becomes only realizable in the
context of our Ontology on top of foundry .
As has been mentioned, the reindustrialization of America is happening in our software, the ability to reimagine your business in a volatile situation
happens in our software.
If you take the 90% of our business that is outside of Europe, which is going through a very structural change and doesn't quite get AI. Maybe in the near
future, we'll get AI, we are hoping and praying, that part of our business grew 49%, 49%. And we're doing this at a very significant scale.
So we're saying we're going to do close to $4 billion in revenue.
And last, not least, we're doing this with double the gold standard on the rule of 40. The Rule of 40 is a very important standard because it shows you the
quality of your revenue and because it's hard to attain, especially if you have a rule of 83. And one of the things that Palantir is doing is we want to bring
our friends and our allies along with us on this winning ride. Those friends are largely in America, but also among allied countries. Those friends are inside
Palantir , outside Palantir . And we are using Ontology and AI, or AIP, to drive these successes. And I would say , while profitability is apparently unpopular ,
the numbers are driven by the fact that we are downstream from value creation.
There's a consensus in the market that Palantir owns value creation. And what does that actually mean? It means that when you use our software, when
you use you will get demonstrably more value than what you're paying for , and you will share some of that value with us. And then I would say also,
culturally , we just don't see the resistance to the way we roll that we did in the past. W e would show up in the past the freak show trying to get things to
work not with the wrong access to the wrong people at the wrong time. And that was by intent. And people were very uncomfortable at all levels of the
enterprise working with us. And without going into specific names, because these companies, in many cases, are in the middle of transforming itself, but it
-- I'm on the front line with everyone here, and it used to be 2 years ago that we might get a CEO, he might get a CIO, we might get someone to
Marketing. W e might get someone who's willing to rebuild the business, but they had no power .
Now we have the full stack engaged with us, inside government, outside government on the most critical issues. And if you -- again, if you look at the math
in terms of where the action is, our business is growing 49% ex Continental Europe, 49%, Rule of 83. W e were the freak show . And we spent 20 years for
this moment and we planned to have [indiscernible] to the grindstone, focused on taking the best talent inside Palantir managing them, the best clients
and make sure our clients and our partners especially in national security , but also with a pretty significant focus on the U.S. win in the way we're winning
and that's why you get these results. And we're going to just focus and focus and focus and focus on execution. And that's basically our plan for the rest of
the year and into next year . And we're very , very optimistic about what's going on. And with that, we can kick it of f to questions.
Ana Soro
Thanks, Alex. W e'll now turn to a few questions from our shareholders before opening up the call.
Our first question is from Gabriel who asks, how does Palantir plan to sustain its competitive advantage in AI, particularly in light of growing competition?
Shyam Sankar
Thanks, Gabriel. W ell, our advantage comes down to Ontology . It's really an advantage on the AI demand side. And that has positioned AIP to be the
platform that is able to capture the ever-expanding capability of the raw LLM and turn that into business value. AIP is that tool factory and the point of
control for the orchestration with these models and those tools.
You can see this in the sharp opinionation that we've earned in the field with our customers and how to get to value in days or weeks. And most critically ,
you can see it in the insight that we have that to practically transform the enterprise.
You actually need mixed human AI teams, and that is something that AIP is uniquely positioned for .
Ana Soro
Thank you, Shyam.
We also received a few questions on this topic. How will the current U.S. administration's focus on reducing federal spend as well as the February
announcement of U.S. Department of Defense budget cuts impact current contracts as well as future contract acquisition.
Shyam Sankar
Well, the first thing I'd say is like this is the right thing for the country . Like we have way too much spend on things that do not work. The government has
started to resemble a finally marbled wagyu. The fake projects that do not deliver and will never deliver crowd out and suf focate the things that could
actually be excellent.
And so we welcome those. I mean, to me, these guys are heroes. They are world-class technologists that could be choosing to do anything and instead,
they are choosing to do this. And we believe deeply in the actual value that our software is creating both on an absolute basis and on a relative basis to
the traditional labor-based cost plus model that has failed to deliver for the American people.
Alexander Karp
We often get variance of if the institutions are in pressure, either we go through a dif ficult time in America or there's dose, how will that af fect your software
sales basically? And Palantir does exceptionally well when things are pentested. W e like pressure on the system. W e need pressure on the system. And
then why is it better for America? Because that pentesting forces you to ask questions like does the software work? How does it work? How does it
manage ethical concerns? How does it manage data protection? How does it manage output.
Without pressure on the system, one of the miss is that if you don't have pressure on the system, you just spend money , you somehow get a better
system, both in terms of output, in terms of ethics. But actually , you get neither and so in reality , we need pressure on the system. W e need people to have
to change. W e need people to have to transform. This is why they put up with us. And once they see those results, they stick with us.
Ana Soro
Thank you both.
Our next question is from Dan with W edbush.
Daniel Ives
Another amazing quarter . I mean just -- so my question is, given what we're seeing in the government, isn't that another opportunity where you could
actually gain more share of budgets as you go to more meritocracy , like Palantir should actually gain more dollars within the budget of DoD and other
agencies.
Alexander Karp
We're very optimistic about what we're going to do in the U.S. But the devil's in the details. And we're running this business for you with you as owners
which means it's like there's going to be maybe lumpiness, but we predict we're going to do very , very well. Any -- basically , where you have pressure
testing, you can assume AIP, AI, foundry , Ontology , Apollo and the Palantir culture itself. I mean we are a warrior culture. Like that's why our whole culture
is built around putting the exact right team and the exact right product at the final mile.
And so where you have environments that are crucial and under pressure, you can expect and where meritocracy happens. It's like we need meritocracy .
How do you get meritocracy . Well, there's lots of ways to get meritocracy . One way is because you're scared. And then you buy the best product, you
install the price product. And then the part that's anti-correlated dif ferent than people think is you also get the best ethics, the best execution and that, of
course, and then you can ask a simple question.
Why is this a move? okay? W ell, I can tell you why it to move? Because here before, no one gets gotten -- no one has gotten into these environments at
scale under any circumstance. And if they did get in, they got in with services.
So now we have a single purpose highly formed stack of software that is exactly right for this moment with a culture that's exactly right to implement it,
which a culture that can teach people how to do this. That is now charismatic for some. It's anticrismatic for others. And that de facto is a compounding
rate of return on that stack and to Shyam's opinion. Shyam's with the opinionation we have about how to do this.
It essentially allows you to express your tribal knowledge of your enterprise in a way you could never do it before on the terms of your enterprise with unit
economics that are heretofore impossible to do. And that's what's happening in this country and really in 90% of our market, which explains like the 49%
growth and the Rule of 83 despite what would be viewed on the outside is large and aptitudes in sales and go-to-market and how do we interact with
people and our opinionation both on the outside, on the inside and with the frontline customer , which is like we're not agnostic to using our software as
shelfwear .
We are not in the shelfwear business, which is another reason why pressure in the government really helps us. W e've never done shelfware. W e don't do
shelfware. W e don't think our personality can af ford shelfware.
Operator
Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America.
Mariana Perez Mora
So I have two questions.
First one is on the European Defense buildup.
You mentioned W arp Speed and how that has been successful here? Like are you interested in applying that as these European countries build up their
own defenses and catch up on industrial capabilities that have been underinvested for like many , many years.
And the second one is, I think investors are pretty familiar with this like software versus services type of like Palantir approach because you have been like
actually leaders on that trend. But Titan is a great example on how like Sofar actually played a role that was more intuitively hard work where else you
actually have opportunities for software to add value there? Like is it Golden dome, is space communications, like have you think about that?
Shyam Sankar
Yes.
On the first one, Alex may have more to say as well. But we would love to help Europe on the manufacturing challenges around rearmament and I think
there are a lot of them to do. the precondition for W arp Speed is understanding that the existing manufacturing stack is broken.
And so you could say , why did America get there first because you have all these people who are essentially the progeny of Elon who have learned and
understood how to actually make things, the sort of brains that go from the Raptor 1 to the Raptor 3 engine, and that's proliferated around the community
that's in El Segundo and even beyond. That's like the basis of reindustrialization in America.
And so it's -- when we work with the new defense champions, new industrial champions like it's a very short sales cycle because they recognize like that
what we're doing with W arp Speed is exactly what they need in order to do it. When you work with some of the older manufacturing customers even in the
U.S., it's heterogeneous.
Some of them are already there. They get it. They realize it.
Some of them are going to be there because it's just a reality . In Europe, there are some green shoots, like some very well-known manufacturing
companies have kind of said like, "Oh, I now understand that my ERP  thing doesn't work and W arp Speed -- maybe we should get a W arp Speed." So I
just don't want to commit to them.
I think a lot of it is where is the customer's head at, but we could obviously do a lot to help you.
Alexander Karp
Europe doesn't get AI yet -- it at some point in the future, it will. And then as you know , Europe is not Europe.
You have Eastern Europe, you have Germany , France, you have -- they're very dif ferent Europes. Europe that is scared understands that you're going to
have to do software, hardware hybrid systems. And our products are very , very well known and dif ferentiated. It could take a couple of years for Europe to
understand that you just can't spend money .
You're going to have to spend it on things that actually work and work means spending it on people that have actually done this on the battlefield. I would
say -- our plan is to continue to be roughly in the zone where 90% of our business is growing like it is now at 49% with this rule of 83.
And somewhere in that range, we guided rule of 80. And that's going to be primarily driven by the U.S. I would say is an unknown variable. W e're seeing
very significant demand for our software, our government software around the world outside of Europe. And those are early days, but the demand -- the
signal there is very strong.

And then on the Titan point, I think that's an excellent point, and it's going to be a big part of the future where you're really thinking about how do you build
your hardware around the software. There are some classified projects that we have as well, where the first step to building the hardware is not to build
the hardware it's actually to build the mission payload and the software that can execute the thing and then work backwards from that to figure out what is
the hardware that you ought to have around that. And this plays to this -- like it is actually a cultural impedance mismatch.
Like if you're a hardware company , you think about the world the way that a construction person would think about building the house.
You have to pour the foundation first, you can't do anything. But actually with software, you have to build the kitchen first.
If you don't, you're going to get it all wrong.
And so there's -- I've seen a lot more of the next-gen programs are starting to think about how do we build the lethal software first, and we'll figure out how
to [indiscernible] the hardware program.

One of the most interesting things about the current environment we're in is something Shyam is alluding to, which is -- and again, it's a European versus
America. People assume if you're a world-class of hardware, you'll be world class of software and they're interchangeable. It's just not true at all. And like
the skills and the taste you need to do software is a completely dif ferent thing. And America's unique advantage is hybrid software, hardware, software.
And any program that's trying to outpace and beat our adversaries at should it basically is going to have to begin with a software first or software
hardware, hybrid program because otherwise, we're at a disadvantage. And also the the resourcing and the way you organize is going to be suboptimal in
this country . Conversely , this is one of the challenges that some of our allies and our adversaries have. The role of taste in getting these things to work,
tribal knowledge and ability to do it is really , really underestimated.
Ana Soro
Thank you. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before you wrap the call
Alexander Karp
This company is organized around giving our friends a really strong shot, I would say , unfair advantage and not helping our adversaries or enemies and on
occasion hurting them. And a lot of you are scattered around the world and helping us in many ways. And we are in a phase where we are very focused on
scaling our company and we really appreciate your support. And the fact that you defend us, our support of W estern values is often under attack for
somewhat idiotic reasons, our belief that meritocracy will lead us to a better place. That competence is better than incompetence that confidence includes
ethics and the results. The fruits of those labors are here today , but they -- none of that would have been possible without your support.
So thank you.
Ana Soro
Thank you. That concludes Q&A  for today's call.
