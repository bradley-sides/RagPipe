I
 
am
 
pleased
 
to
 
announce
 
Q2
 
revenue
 
of
 
$20.5
 
million
 
at
 
the
 
top
 
end
 
of
 
our
 
guidance
 
which
 
completes
 
the
 
first
 
half
 
of
 
2024
 
with
 
nearly
 
40%
 
revenue
 
increase
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
prior
 
year,
 
despite
 
a
 
slowdown
 
in
 
most
 
semiconductor
 
end
 
markets.
 
Gallium
 
nitride
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
continue
 
to
 
take
 
share
 
from
 
legacy
 
silicon
 
chips.
 
Our
 
GaNSafe
 
ICs
 
offer
 
the
 
highest
 
performance,
 
most
 
reliable,
 
and
 
most
 
protected
 
GaN
 
power
 
device
 
in
 
our
 
industry
 
and
 
continue
 
to
 
drive
 
new
 
business
 
at
 
an
 
extraordinary
 
pace.
 
GaNSafe
 
is
 
now
 
being
 
qualified
 
or
 
designed
 
into
 
over
 
100
 
customer
 
projects,
 
spending
 
4
 
different
 
end
 
markets
 
and
 
in
 
all
 
major
 
regions
 
around
 
the
 
world.
 
Our
 
latest
 
Generation
 
3
 
fast
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technology
 
has
 
improved
 
performance
 
by
 
an
 
additional
 
20%
 
compared
 
to
 
our
 
prior
 
generation,
 
which
 
already
 
demonstrated
 
the
 
industry's
 
leading
 
efficiency
 
and
 
thermal
 
performance,
 
and
 
now
 
also
 
has
 
over
 
100
 
customer
 
projects
 
in
 
our
 
pipeline.
 
The
 
combination
 
of
 
GaNSafe
 
and
 
Gen-3
 
Fast
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
for
 
AI
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
EV
 
onboard
 
chargers
 
are
 
creating
 
next-gen
 
power
 
systems
 
that
 
exceed
 
even
 
our
 
own
 
expectations
 
and
 
set
 
new
 
industry
 
standards,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
power
 
density,
 
energy
 
efficiency,
 
and
 
system
 
costs.
 
Let
 
me
 
give
 
further
 
specifics
 
in
 
each
 
of
 
our
 
target
 
markets.
 
The
 
AI
 
data
 
center
 
market
 
continues
 
to
 
evolve
 
at
 
a
 
rapid
 
and
 
exciting
 
pace.
 
Traditional
 
servers
 
required
 
a
 
total
 
power
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
30
 
kilowatts
 
per
 
rack.
 
With
 
NVIDIA's
 
Grace
 
Hopper
 
GPUs,
 
those
 
power
 
levels
 
are
 
being
 
pushed
 
to
 
60
 
or
 
even
 
120
 
kilowatts.
 
With
 
Blackwell,
 
Ultra
 
and
 
Rubin,
 
we
 
are
 
targeting
 
240
 
and
 
even
 
480
 
kilowatts
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
2
 
years.
 
Our
 
system
 
design
 
center
 
focused
 
on
 
data
 
centers
 
has
 
stepped
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
challenge
 
with
 
AC
 
to
 
DC
 
server
 
power
 
supply
 
platforms
 
expanding
 
rapidly
 
from
 
2.7
 
to
 
3.2
 
to
 
4.5
 
kilowatts,
 
and
 
targeting
 
8
 
to
 
10
 
kilowatts
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
The
 
recently
 
announced
 
4.5
 
kilowatt
 
platform
 
combines
 
our
 
newest
 
Gen-3
 
Fast
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
in
 
the
 
front
 
end
 
power
 
factor
 
correction
 
or
 
PFC
 
section
 
with
 
the
 
industry
 
leading
 
GaNSafe
 
technology
 
in
 
the
 
back
 
end
 
LLC
 
portion
 
to
 
set
 
new
 
industry
 
benchmarks
 
with
 
energy
 
efficiencies
 
of
 
97%
 
and
 
power
 
densities
 
of
 
nearly
 
140
 
watts
 
per
 
cubic
 
inch.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
our
 
data
 
center
 
pipeline
 
has
 
grown
 
rapidly
 
faster
 
than
 
any
 
other
 
segment
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
3
 
months
 
and
 
has
 
doubled
 
since
 
our
 
Investor
 
Day
 
in
 
December.
 
Now,
 
with
 
over
 
60
 
customer
 
projects
 
in
 
development,
 
we're
 
pleased
 
to
 
announce
 
another
 
7
 
data
 
center
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
Q2.
 
In
 
addition,
 
I'm
 
excited
 
to
 
announce
 
a
 
major
 
technology
 
innovation
 
from
 
our
 
system
 
design
 
center.
 
Traditional
 
PFC
 
circuits
 
operate
 
at
 
low
 
frequency
 
with
 
moderate
 
efficiencies.
 
Our
 
team
 
has
 
unlocked
 
an
 
additional
 
30%
 
energy
 
savings,
 
4
 
data
 
center
 
PFC
 
circuits,
 
by
 
innovating
 
a
 
novel
 
high
 
frequency
 
soft
 
switching
 
control
 
method,
 
which
 
translates
 
to
 
over
 
99%
 
peak
 
efficiency
 
for
 
that
 
PFC
 
section
 
with
 
higher
 
power
 
densities
 
and
 
attractive
 
costs.
 
This
 
technology
 
is
 
patent
 
pending
 
and
 
is
 
available
 
immediately
 
for
 
our
 
customers
 
to
 
implement
 
for
 
their
 
Blackwell
 
and
 
Blackwell
 
Ultra
 
designs,
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
integrated
 
with
 
our
 
8
 
kilowatt
 
and
 
higher
 
designs
 
while
 
we
 
retrofit
 
the
 
4.5
 
and
 
3.2
 
kilowatt
 
platforms
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
months.
 
In
 
electric
 
vehicles,
 
we
 
see
 
strong
 
growth
 
in
 
our
 
customer
 
pipeline,
 
which
 
now
 
includes
 
over
 
200
 
customer
 
projects
 
and
 
is
 
the
 
largest
 
segment
 
of
 
our
 
pipeline.
 
Our
 
latest
 
22
 
kilowatt
 
onboard
 
charger
 
platform,
 
which
 
enables
 
3x
 
faster
 
charging
 
with
 
2x
 
higher
 
power
 
density,
 
30%
 
energy
 
savings,
 
and
 
40%
 
lighter
 
compared
 
to
 
comparable
 
solutions
 
on
 
the
 
market.
 
We're
 
seeing
 
strong
 
interest,
 
this
 
platform
 
has
 
contributed
 
to
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
15
 
new
 
customer
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
Q2,
 
which
 
includes
 
3
 
major
 
new
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
wins
 
that
 
will
 
start
 
production
 
next
 
year,
 
while
 
we're
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
our
 
first
 
GaN
 
EV
 
revenues
 
to
 
start
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2025.
 
The
 
customer
 
pipeline
 
in
 
both
 
appliance
 
and
 
industrial
 
segments
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
strong
 
and
 
growing
 
well
 
beyond
 
the
 
$380
 
million
 
we
 
stated
 
in
 
December,
 
with
 
strong
 
ramp
 
expected
 
in
 
2025
 
across
 
diverse
 
customers
 
and
 
regions,
 
including
 
7
 
of
 
the
 
top
 
10
 
appliance
 
leaders,
 
with
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
25
 
new
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
Q2
 
expected
 
to
 
ramp
 
production
 
next
 
year
 
or
 
2026.
 
These
 
customer
 
projects
 
span
 
hair
 
care
 
applications,
 
washers,
 
dryers,
 
refrigerators,
 
heat
 
pumps,
 
industrial
 
HVAC,
 
robotics,
 
and
 
automation
 
applications.
 
While
 
the
 
solar
 
industry
 
experienced
 
a
 
significant
 
slowdown
 
due
 
to
 
higher
 
interest
 
rates
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
18
 
months,
 
as
 
displacement
 
technologies,
 
we
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
over
 
100
 
customer
 
projects
 
with
 
GaN
 
for
 
residential
 
microinverters
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
for
 
higher
 
power,
 
higher
 
voltage
 
string
 
inverters,
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
their
 
related
 
energy
 
storage
 
systems.
 
We
 
continue
 
strong
 
engagements
 
with
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
top
 
10
 
solar
 
players
 
and
 
are
 
pleased
 
to
 
announce
 
another
 
6
 
customer
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
Q2.
 
We
 
are
 
also
 
progressing
 
well
 
for
 
a
 
major
 
U.S.
 
GaN
 
based
 
microinverter
 
ramp
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
half
 
of
 
next
 
year.
 
GaN
 
revenue
 
growth
 
continues
 
in
 
mobile
 
markets
 
as
 
all
 
major
 
OEMs
 
across
 
smartphones,
 
tablets
 
and
 
notebooks
 
continue
 
to
 
increase
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
in
 
their
 
fast
 
charger
 
portfolios
 
over
 
legacy
 
silicon
 
power
 
chips.
 
As
 
discussed
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
call,
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
in
 
customers
 
such
 
as
 
Xiaomi
 
and
 
Oppo
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
30%
 
this
 
year.
 
Following
 
our
 
fast
 
charger
 
design
 
wins
 
for
 
Samsung's
 
Galaxy
 
S23
 
and
 
S24
 
phones,
 
we
 
are
 
pleased
 
to
 
announce
 
that
 
the
 
new
 
Galaxy
 
Z
 
Flip6,
 
Z
 
Fold6,
 
and
 
all
 
A
 
series
 
phones,
 
as
 
revealed
 
during
 
July's
 
Galaxy
 
Unpacked
 
event,
 
now
 
use
 
Navitas
 
GaNFast
 
technology
 
to
 
deliver
 
fast,
 
light,
 
truly
 
portable,
 
fast
 
charging
 
experiences
 
for
 
the
 
consumer.
 
Growth
 
in
 
the
 
laptop,
 
PC
 
market
 
resumed
 
in
 
Q1,
 
with
 
GaNFast
 
adopted
 
again
 
by
 
Lenovo
 
for
 
105
 
and
 
170
 
watt
 
fast
 
chargers
 
and
 
again
 
by
 
Dell,
 
this
 
time
 
for
 
100
 
and
 
130
 
watts,
 
achieving
 
up
 
to
 
50%
 
size
 
reduction.
 
Overall,
 
Q2
 
saw
 
another
 
16
 
charger
 
launches,
 
bringing
 
the
 
total
 
to
 
over
 
470
 
production
 
designs,
 
and
 
Navitas
 
remains
 
#1
 
in
 
mobile
 
fast
 
charging.
 
Our
 
new
 
GaNSlim
 
portfolio
 
with
 
integration,
 
ease-of-use
 
and
 
low-cost
 
manufacturing
 
methods
 
continues
 
to
 
grow
 
the
 
customer
 
pipeline,
 
now
 
with
 
over
 
50
 
customer
 
projects.
 
GaNSlim
 
increases
 
our
 
GaN
 
served
 
market
 
by
 
enabling
 
lower
 
system
 
costs
 
compared
 
to
 
silicon
 
design,
 
for
 
many
 
applications,
 
targeting
 
applications
 
under
 
500
 
watts
 
across
 
mobile,
 
consumer
 
and
 
home
 
appliance.
 
Overall,
 
I'm
 
pleased
 
with
 
our
 
Q2
 
results
 
at
 
the
 
high
 
end
 
of
 
our
 
guidance,
 
combined
 
with
 
the
 
growth
 
of
 
our
 
pipeline,
 
major
 
new
 
design
 
wins
 
and
 
significant
 
new
 
technology
 
launches.
 
Electrification
 
and
 
energy
 
savings
 
have
 
never
 
been
 
more
 
important
 
and
 
Navitas
 
is
 
well-positioned
 
as
 
the
 
only
 
pure
 
play
 
next-gen
 
power
 
semi
 
company
 
with
 
leading-edge
 
gallium
 
nitride
 
and
 
sodium
 
carbide
 
technology.
 
With
 
that,
 
let
 
me
 
turn
 
it
 
over
 
to
 
our
 
CFO,
 
Janet
 
Chao
 
to
 
discuss
 
the
 
financials.
 
Janet
 
Tao
 
Chou
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Gene.
 
In
 
my
 
comments
 
today,
 
I
 
will
 
first
 
take
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
second
 
quarter
 
financial
 
results
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
outlook
 
for
 
the
 
third
 
quarter.
 
Revenue
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024
 
grew
 
13%
 
year-over-year
 
to
 
$20.5
 
million.
 
While
 
we
 
are
 
experiencing
 
similar
 
macroeconomic
 
factors
 
as
 
others
 
in
 
certain
 
of
 
our
 
end
 
markets,
 
our
 
mobile
 
business
 
was
 
strong
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter,
 
demonstrating
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
our
 
smaller,
 
faster,
 
more
 
energy-efficient
 
technology,
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
gain
 
significant
 
traction
 
in
 
mobile
 
and
 
consumer
 
charging
 
applications.
 
Before
 
addressing
 
expenses,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
you
 
to
 
the
 
GAAP
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
reconciliations
 
in
 
our
 
press
 
release
 
earlier
 
today.
 
In
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
my
 
commentary,
 
I
 
will
 
refer
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
expense
 
measures.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
was
 
40.3%
 
compared
 
to
 
41.5%,
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
of
 
2023,
 
due
 
to
 
mobile
 
market
 
product
 
mix,
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
see
 
strength
 
in
 
that
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
business.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
was
 
down
 
sequentially
 
from
 
41.1%.
 
Total
 
operating
 
expenses
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
were
 
relatively
 
flat
 
sequentially
 
at
 
$21.5
 
million,
 
comprised
 
of
 
SG&A
 
expenses
 
of
 
$9
 
million
 
and
 
R&D
 
expenses
 
of
 
$12.5
 
million.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
demonstration
 
of
 
our
 
focus
 
on
 
operating
 
efficiency.
 
Adding
 
all
 
this
 
together,
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
2024
 
loss
 
from
 
operations
 
was
 
$13.3
 
million.
 
Our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
was
 
183
 
million
 
shares.
 
Turning
 
to
 
the
 
balance
 
sheet.
 
It
 
remains
 
very
 
strong
 
with
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
liquidity.
 
Cash
 
and
 
cash
 
equivalents
 
at
 
quarter
 
end
 
were
 
$112
 
million
 
and
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
carry
 
no
 
debt.
 
While
 
accounts
 
receivable
 
was
 
relatively
 
flat
 
at
 
$22.7
 
million
 
compared
 
to
 
$22.2
 
million.
 
In
 
the
 
prior
 
quarter,
 
we
 
made
 
good
 
progress
 
on
 
reducing
 
inventory
 
to
 
$25.2
 
million
 
from
 
$33.2
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
prior
 
quarter.
 
Our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
improve
 
our
 
working
 
capital.
 
Moving
 
on
 
to
 
guidance
 
for
 
the
 
third
 
quarter,
 
we
 
currently
 
expect
 
revenues
 
of
 
$22
 
million
 
plus
 
or
 
minus
 
500,000.
 
At
 
the
 
midpoint,
 
this
 
represents
 
a
 
sequential
 
growth
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
7%.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
for
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
40%
 
plus
 
or
 
minus
 
50
 
basis
 
points.
 
As
 
our
 
mix
 
continues
 
to
 
lean
 
more
 
towards
 
the
 
mobile
 
market
 
in
 
the
 
near-term.
 
We
 
expect
 
margin
 
improvements
 
will
 
align
 
with
 
demand
 
recovery
 
in
 
higher
 
margin
 
markets.
 
In
 
total,
 
our
 
non-GAAP
 
operating
 
expenses
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
$21.5
 
million
 
and
 
this
 
excludes
 
stock-based
 
compensation
 
and
 
amortization
 
of
 
intangible
 
assets.
 
We're
 
keeping
 
our
 
expenses
 
as
 
flat
 
as
 
possible,
 
as
 
we
 
improve
 
our
 
efficiency
 
and
 
optimize
 
our
 
cost
 
structure,
 
while
 
supporting
 
our
 
growth
 
initiatives.
 
For
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024,
 
we
 
expect
 
our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
185
 
million
 
shares.
 
In
 
closing,
 
we're
 
pleased
 
with
 
our
 
second
 
quarter
 
performance,
 
which
 
includes
 
good
 
progress
 
in
 
expense
 
management
 
and
 
improvements
 
in
 
working
 
capital.
 
This
 
positions
 
us
 
well
 
to
 
scale
 
the
 
business
 
towards
 
long-term
 
growth
 
and
 
profitability.
 
Operator,
 
let's
 
begin
 
the
 
Q&A
 
session.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
And
 
your
 
first
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
with
 
Deutsche
 
Bank.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
Gene,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
get
 
an
 
update
 
on
 
what
 
you're
 
seeing
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
the
 
end
 
market
 
trends.
 
And
 
really
 
what
 
I'm
 
going
 
for
 
is
 
everybody
 
knows
 
that
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
rebound
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
little
 
slower
 
in
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
end
 
markets,
 
but
 
how
 
are
 
you
 
seeing
 
the
 
macro
 
side
 
and
 
more
 
importantly,
 
the
 
company-specific
 
ramps?
 
Any
 
pushouts,
 
pull-ins
 
in
 
those
 
ramps,
 
any
 
color
 
on
 
your
 
visibility
 
would
 
be
 
great?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
You
 
bet.
 
Ross.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
the
 
question.
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
good
 
news
 
with
 
the
 
choppy
 
market
 
today
 
is
 
that
 
we're
 
not
 
seeing
 
pushouts
 
and
 
delays.
 
That's
 
pretty
 
fundamental
 
to
 
our
 
mid
 
to
 
long-term
 
outlook.
 
In
 
fact,
 
the
 
pipeline,
 
as
 
I
 
highlighted
 
in
 
the
 
prepared
 
remarks,
 
continues
 
to
 
grow,
 
across
 
all
 
segments.
 
We
 
see
 
growth
 
with
 
EV,
 
especially
 
around
 
onboard
 
chargers.
 
That's
 
a
 
focus
 
area
 
for
 
us,
 
not
 
only
 
with
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
in
 
the
 
near-term,
 
but
 
GaN
 
in
 
the
 
medium-term,
 
late
 
'25
 
and
 
into
 
'26.
 
We're
 
really
 
pleased
 
with
 
appliance
 
and
 
industrial,
 
even
 
though
 
that
 
market's
 
a
 
little
 
softer
 
on
 
volume,
 
25
 
new
 
design
 
wins.
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
an
 
all-time
 
high,
 
and
 
that's
 
pretty
 
broad-based
 
as
 
I
 
highlighted.
 
Hair
 
care
 
dryers,
 
washing
 
machines,
 
refrigerators,
 
heat
 
pumps
 
is
 
a
 
big
 
one.
 
These
 
--
 
that
 
market
 
takes
 
a
 
little
 
longer,
 
as
 
we've
 
been
 
talking
 
about,
 
but
 
now
 
we're
 
getting
 
close
 
to
 
those
 
ramps.
 
Quite
 
a
 
few
 
of
 
them
 
in
 
'25,
 
even
 
more
 
in
 
'26.
 
Even
 
solar,
 
which
 
has
 
probably
 
hit
 
the
 
hardest
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
18
 
months,
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned,
 
still
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
that
 
GaN
 
launch.
 
Next
 
year,
 
we
 
see
 
GaN
 
moving
 
into
 
a
 
beachhead
 
position
 
on
 
microinverters,
 
as
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
for
 
many
 
quarters.
 
But
 
also
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
continues
 
to
 
win
 
more
 
on
 
the
 
commercial
 
string
 
inverter
 
side.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
I
 
got
 
to
 
highlight
 
AI
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
enterprise
 
in
 
general.
 
Coming
 
from
 
a
 
0
 
base,
 
it's
 
still
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
smaller
 
segments
 
for
 
us,
 
but
 
it
 
doubled
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
customer
 
projects.
 
30
 
in
 
Q1,
 
60
 
now
 
with
 
3
 
design
 
wins
 
we
 
highlighted
 
in
 
Q1,
 
now
 
7.
 
So
 
we
 
like
 
those
 
trends.
 
It's
 
not
 
too
 
meaningful
 
this
 
year,
 
but
 
really
 
starts
 
to
 
be
 
appreciable
 
in
 
the
 
overall
 
revenue
 
next
 
year
 
and
 
continues
 
to
 
grow
 
strongly
 
with
 
those
 
sort
 
of
 
power
 
increases
 
that
 
I
 
talked
 
about
 
in
 
my
 
remarks.
 
So
 
all
 
that
 
stuff's
 
pretty
 
encouraging.
 
I
 
don't
 
highlight
 
mobile
 
consumer
 
because
 
that
 
is
 
our
 
position
 
of
 
strength,
 
that's
 
where
 
we're
 
seeing
 
upsides
 
in
 
the
 
near-term.
 
But
 
that's
 
certainly
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
away
 
as
 
well,
 
it
 
will
 
just
 
become
 
a
 
smaller
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
pipeline
 
over
 
time.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
That's
 
very
 
helpful.
 
I
 
guess
 
just
 
my
 
one
 
follow-up,
 
either
 
for
 
you
 
or
 
Janet.
 
On
 
the
 
gross
 
margin
 
side,
 
when
 
those
 
company-specific
 
design
 
wins
 
that
 
you
 
just
 
went
 
through,
 
Gene
 
start
 
to
 
ramp
 
over
 
time.
 
How
 
do
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
gross
 
margin
 
puts
 
or
 
takes?
 
I
 
think
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
accretive,
 
but
 
when
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
those
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
being
 
built-in
 
in
 
a
 
more
 
meaningful
 
way?
 
And
 
what's
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
aspirational
 
gross
 
margin
 
targets
 
you
 
think
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
year
 
or
 
2
 
that
 
the
 
company
 
could
 
attain?
 
Janet
 
Tao
 
Chou
 
Ross,
 
thank
 
you
 
for
 
your
 
question.
 
Let
 
me
 
first
 
take
 
that.
 
And
 
Gene
 
can
 
add
 
more
 
color.
 
Our
 
gross
 
margin
 
is
 
heavily
 
dependent
 
on
 
mix.
 
We're
 
seeing
 
very
 
strong
 
momentum
 
going
 
on
 
in
 
mobile.
 
Last
 
year,
 
mobile
 
is
 
less
 
than
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
revenue.
 
Now
 
this
 
year,
 
year-to-date,
 
mobile
 
is
 
more
 
than
 
half.
 
So
 
that's
 
kind
 
of
 
margin
 
diluted.
 
But
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
we're
 
doing
 
everything
 
we
 
can
 
to
 
drive
 
margin
 
improvement.
 
We've
 
been
 
doing
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
work
 
with
 
our
 
suppliers
 
to
 
negotiate
 
down,
 
price.
 
As
 
those
 
demands
 
start
 
to
 
ramp
 
up
 
in
 
higher
 
margin
 
markets
 
like
 
solar,
 
EV,
 
or
 
industrial,
 
we
 
will
 
see
 
margin
 
improvement.
 
We're
 
still
 
very
 
committed
 
to
 
the
 
long-term
 
gross
 
margin
 
target
 
of
 
50%
 
and
 
above.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
And
 
if
 
I
 
add
 
to
 
that,
 
Ross,
 
just
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
relate
 
it
 
back
 
to
 
your
 
earlier
 
question,
 
the
 
market
 
mix,
 
and
 
the
 
pipeline,
 
we're
 
winning
 
these
 
customers,
 
we're
 
pricing
 
them.
 
We
 
know
 
what
 
those
 
price
 
points
 
are.
 
We
 
know
 
what's
 
coming
 
to
 
in
 
'25
 
and
 
'26.
 
So
 
that
 
adds
 
to
 
our
 
confidence
 
as
 
Janet
 
said
 
that
 
it's
 
a
 
market
 
mix-based
 
approach.
 
While
 
we're
 
--
 
I
 
think,
 
practical
 
about
 
realistic
 
about
 
mobile
 
consumer
 
being
 
below
 
that
 
average
 
in
 
the
 
short-term
 
and
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
long-term,
 
for
 
obvious
 
reasons,
 
the
 
other
 
markets,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
feel
 
confident
 
and
 
good
 
about
 
being
 
at
 
that
 
long-term
 
margin
 
model,
 
if
 
not
 
higher,
 
driving
 
the
 
overall
 
corporate
 
average
 
where
 
it
 
needs
 
to
 
be.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
puts
 
us
 
in
 
a
 
good
 
place,
 
and
 
that's
 
why
 
we
 
we're
 
comfortable
 
reiterating
 
those
 
margin
 
targets.
 
Operator
 
Your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Blayne
 
Curtis
 
with
 
Jefferies.
 
Blayne
 
Curtis
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
follow-up
 
on
 
Ross's
 
question.
 
Last,
 
I
 
guess,
 
in
 
the
 
June
 
quarter,
 
it
 
seemed
 
like
 
mobile
 
was
 
growing
 
and
 
everything
 
else
 
was
 
kind
 
of
 
correcting.
 
I
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
understand,
 
are
 
the
 
other
 
kind
 
of
 
non-mobile
 
businesses
 
flattening
 
out,
 
or
 
are
 
they
 
still
 
declining
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
to
 
September?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
We
 
don't
 
break
 
it
 
up
 
by
 
quarter
 
by
 
market.
 
But
 
what
 
I
 
can
 
say
 
is,
 
yes,
 
we've
 
seen
 
further
 
upsides
 
on
 
mobile
 
and
 
consumer,
 
which
 
is
 
helpful
 
on
 
the
 
top
 
line,
 
and
 
now
 
we're
 
sequentially
 
growing
 
into
 
Q3
 
as
 
we
 
guided.
 
At
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
solar
 
in
 
particular
 
is
 
still
 
a
 
pretty
 
small
 
percentage,
 
quite
 
a
 
bit
 
down
 
from
 
where
 
it
 
was
 
last
 
year.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
the
 
one.
 
We've
 
probably
 
seen
 
a
 
trade-off
 
between
 
solar
 
as
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
revenue
 
versus
 
mobile
 
consumer,
 
skewing
 
that
 
gross
 
margin
 
a
 
bit.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
things
 
are
 
pretty
 
stable
 
on
 
the
 
others,
 
EV,
 
appliance
 
and
 
industrial,
 
and
 
of
 
course,
 
enterprise
 
is
 
really
 
just
 
getting
 
started.
 
Here's
 
a
 
0
 
point
 
as
 
we're
 
just
 
ramping
 
those
 
programs.
 
So
 
that's
 
how
 
I'd
 
see
 
sort
 
of
 
the
 
pluses
 
and
 
minuses
 
across
 
the
 
markets
 
and
 
the
 
margin
 
improvements.
 
Blayne
 
Curtis
 
Helpful.
 
And
 
I'm
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
curious
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
long-term,
 
the
 
--
 
between
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
4
 
segments
 
outside
 
of
 
mobile
 
data
 
center,
 
the
 
EV,
 
mobility
 
appliances,
 
and
 
solar.
 
Just
 
kind
 
of
 
curious.
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
the
 
pipeline
 
building.
 
I'm
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
curious
 
between
 
those
 
4.
 
Which
 
one
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
will
 
contribute
 
revenue
 
the
 
earliest?
 
And
 
is
 
that
 
mostly
 
next
 
year,
 
or
 
could
 
you
 
see
 
some
 
even
 
into
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
this
 
year?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
We're
 
already
 
shipping
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
into
 
EV
 
and
 
solar.
 
We're
 
already
 
shipping
 
GaN
 
into
 
appliance
 
and
 
shipping
 
SiC
 
into
 
industrial.
 
So
 
we've
 
got
 
a
 
base
 
of
 
business
 
in
 
each
 
of
 
those,
 
but
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
layering
 
in
 
new
 
growth.
 
GaN
 
going
 
into
 
solar
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time
 
next
 
year
 
in
 
ramping,
 
GaN
 
going
 
into
 
EV
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
'25,
 
ramping
 
in
 
'26.
 
Both
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
ramping
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time
 
in
 
appreciable
 
production
 
volumes
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
this
 
year.
 
So
 
they're
 
all
 
sort
 
of
 
layering
 
in
 
at
 
different
 
times.
 
And
 
those
 
are
 
largely
 
driven
 
out
 
by
 
product
 
availability,
 
but
 
just
 
design
 
time
 
from
 
when
 
we
 
launched
 
the
 
higher
 
power
 
GaN
 
and
 
other
 
new
 
products
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
year.
 
Operator
 
Your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
with
 
Needham.
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
I
 
guess
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
start,
 
I
 
believe
 
last
 
quarter
 
you
 
guys
 
seemed
 
to
 
feel
 
comfortable
 
with
 
a
 
growth
 
rate
 
in
 
'24
 
of
 
about
 
20%
 
for
 
the
 
full
 
year.
 
The
 
September
 
guide
 
looks
 
like
 
it's
 
coming
 
in
 
below
 
consensus.
 
And
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
if
 
you're
 
willing
 
to
 
comment
 
on
 
a
 
growth
 
rate
 
for
 
the
 
year,
 
but
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
sort
 
of
 
level
 
set
 
where
 
you
 
think
 
2024
 
might
 
come
 
out.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
We
 
didn't
 
formally
 
guide,
 
but
 
certainly
 
anticipated
 
a
 
moderated
 
growth
 
rate
 
this
 
year.
 
We
 
still
 
feel
 
good
 
about
 
it.
 
Obviously,
 
it's
 
important
 
that
 
Q3
 
is
 
now
 
sequentially
 
growing
 
7%
 
from
 
Q2.
 
We're
 
not
 
formally
 
guiding
 
Q4,
 
but
 
feel
 
good
 
about
 
a
 
growth
 
outlook
 
going
 
from
 
Q3
 
to
 
Q4,
 
and
 
certainly
 
feel
 
good
 
about
 
growth
 
rates
 
obviously
 
going
 
into
 
next
 
year,
 
albeit
 
not
 
giving
 
a
 
formal
 
guide
 
yet.
 
So
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
go
 
by
 
quarter-by-quarter.
 
But
 
I'd
 
say
 
that's
 
kind
 
of
 
the
 
color
 
commentary
 
I
 
would
 
offer
 
up.
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
Got
 
it.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
given
 
us
 
really
 
good
 
detail
 
on
 
the
 
customer
 
engagements,
 
customer
 
pipelines.
 
But
 
the
 
near-term,
 
it
 
does
 
feel
 
like
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
projects
 
are
 
either
 
delayed
 
or
 
maybe
 
it's
 
just
 
taking
 
longer
 
to
 
clear
 
inventory
 
before
 
some
 
new
 
projects
 
take
 
off.
 
And
 
so
 
I'm
 
wondering,
 
can
 
you
 
give
 
us
 
any
 
commentary
 
about
 
bookings
 
trends,
 
backlog?
 
I
 
think
 
you've
 
got
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
questions,
 
but
 
do
 
you
 
feel
 
like
 
you're
 
starting
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
turn
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
other
 
markets
 
beyond
 
mobile?
 
Just
 
kind
 
of
 
--
 
besides
 
the
 
customer
 
activity,
 
which
 
maybe
 
at
 
no
 
fault
 
of
 
your
 
own,
 
is
 
subject
 
to
 
getting
 
delayed
 
or
 
pushed
 
out
 
in
 
time,
 
what
 
gives
 
you
 
confidence
 
that
 
the
 
growth
 
accelerates
 
next
 
year?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
think
 
short-term
 
backlog
 
coverage
 
for
 
near-term
 
quarters
 
is
 
solid.
 
That's
 
encouraging.
 
Inventory
 
correction,
 
as
 
we
 
said,
 
pockets
 
of
 
inventory
 
definitely
 
in
 
the
 
channel,
 
but
 
we
 
see
 
those
 
stable
 
to
 
improving.
 
So
 
that's
 
encouraging.
 
And
 
then
 
not
 
seeing
 
the
 
projects
 
pushout,
 
staying
 
on
 
track.
 
I
 
don't
 
think,
 
we
 
saw
 
any
 
appreciable
 
pushouts
 
or
 
delays
 
or
 
certainly
 
cancellations.
 
So
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
day,
 
it
 
comes
 
down
 
to
 
the
 
actual
 
production
 
volumes.
 
Customers
 
can
 
be
 
on
 
schedule,
 
they
 
can
 
launch
 
on
 
time,
 
but
 
are
 
they
 
launching
 
at
 
20%
 
less
 
volume
 
or
 
20%
 
higher
 
volume?
 
And
 
those
 
are
 
things
 
that
 
ultimately
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
until
 
you
 
get
 
closer
 
and
 
the
 
orders
 
are
 
coming
 
in.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
other
 
points
 
about
 
inventory
 
backlog
 
coverage
 
are
 
encouraging.
 
So
 
we're
 
cautiously
 
optimistic,
 
but
 
just
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
ahead
 
of
 
ourselves
 
in
 
this
 
choppy
 
market.
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
Got
 
it.
 
So
 
it
 
sounds
 
like
 
it's
 
maybe
 
more
 
fluctuations
 
in
 
those
 
production
 
volumes
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
the
 
biggest
 
swing
 
factor
 
rather
 
than
 
projects
 
pushing
 
out.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
exactly.
 
And
 
obviously
 
that's
 
on
 
running
 
programs
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
on
 
new
 
programs.
 
So
 
that's
 
a
 
good
 
summary
 
point.
 
Operator
 
Your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
with
 
Charter
 
Equity
 
Research.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
So
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
one
 
on
 
data
 
center.
 
I'm
 
curious
 
as
 
to
 
what
 
the
 
biggest
 
challenges
 
are
 
for
 
the
 
industry
 
to
 
increase
 
the
 
power
 
level
 
of
 
power
 
supply.
 
So
 
you've
 
talked
 
about
 
going
 
from
 
3.2
 
kilowatts
 
to
 
4.5
 
more
 
recently
 
and
 
then
 
aspirations
 
for
 
8
 
to
 
10
 
kilowatts
 
eventually.
 
When
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
product
 
design,
 
for
 
those
 
server
 
power
 
supplies,
 
what
 
becomes,
 
I
 
guess,
 
the
 
long
 
pole
 
in
 
the
 
tent?
 
Is
 
it
 
the
 
power
 
chips
 
themselves
 
and
 
whether
 
they
 
can
 
developing
 
them
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
handle
 
more
 
power
 
without
 
breaking
 
down?
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
basically
 
wondering
 
if
 
the
 
chips
 
themselves
 
are
 
the
 
limiting
 
factor
 
or
 
if
 
it's
 
something
 
else.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
follow-up.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
You
 
bet,
 
Jack.
 
That's
 
a
 
good
 
question
 
for
 
sure.
 
And
 
really
 
it
 
does
 
come
 
down
 
to
 
the
 
switching
 
speed
 
and
 
the
 
efficiency
 
of
 
the
 
power
 
chips.
 
If
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
the
 
gallium
 
nitride
 
or
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
chips
 
to
 
switch
 
faster
 
and
 
more
 
efficiently,
 
the
 
speed
 
actually
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
shrink
 
the
 
mechanical
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
other
 
passive
 
components,
 
the
 
transformers,
 
inductors
 
and
 
filters,
 
capacitors.
 
When
 
they
 
shrink,
 
not
 
only
 
are
 
they
 
coming
 
down
 
in
 
size
 
to
 
pack
 
more
 
power
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
size,
 
you're
 
also
 
shrinking
 
the
 
case
 
size,
 
the
 
mechanicals,
 
the
 
PCBs.
 
And
 
so
 
mechanical
 
shrink
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
from
 
the
 
speed
 
of
 
gallium
 
nitride
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
At
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
you've
 
got
 
to
 
worry
 
about
 
the
 
heat.
 
You
 
have
 
more
 
heat
 
to
 
pack
 
into
 
a
 
smaller
 
space
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
improve
 
the
 
efficiency.
 
And
 
that's
 
why
 
efficiency
 
is
 
the
 
other
 
critical
 
one.
 
So
 
you'll
 
see
 
us
 
constantly
 
talking
 
about
 
pushing
 
frequencies
 
up
 
and
 
pushing
 
efficiencies
 
up.
 
We
 
talked
 
about
 
doing
 
--
 
now
 
targeting
 
98%
 
efficiency.
 
That's
 
2
 
points
 
bigger,
 
25%
 
less
 
power
 
loss,
 
compared
 
to
 
that
 
titanium
 
standard
 
of
 
96,
 
which
 
is
 
actually
 
really
 
hard
 
to
 
hit
 
for
 
silicon,
 
let
 
alone
 
anybody
 
else
 
in
 
the
 
GaN
 
or
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
space.
 
So
 
speed
 
and
 
efficiency
 
are
 
the
 
key.
 
And
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
highlight
 
in
 
my
 
remarks
 
about
 
that
 
PFC
 
circuit.
 
The
 
PFC
 
circuit
 
power
 
factor
 
correction
 
traditionally
 
is
 
running
 
at
 
slow
 
speeds
 
in
 
mediocre
 
efficiency.
 
And
 
that's
 
been
 
holding
 
us
 
all
 
back.
 
Even
 
when
 
you
 
add
 
gallium
 
nitride
 
or
 
silicon
 
carbide,
 
traditionally,
 
you
 
might
 
get
 
1
 
point
 
in
 
efficiency,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
big
 
deal,
 
but
 
still
 
not
 
as
 
high
 
as
 
we
 
wanted.
 
The
 
fact
 
that
 
our
 
team
 
has
 
invented
 
a
 
new
 
architecture
 
for
 
PFC
 
that
 
pushes
 
another
 
30%
 
energy
 
savings
 
is
 
a
 
really
 
big
 
deal
 
and
 
does
 
it
 
at
 
higher
 
switching
 
speeds.
 
So
 
we're
 
nailing
 
those
 
2
 
things.
 
And
 
ultimately,
 
that's
 
what
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
take,
 
speed
 
and
 
efficiency,
 
to
 
deliver
 
a
 
lot
 
more
 
power
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
size
 
rack
 
or
 
tray
 
or
 
individual
 
server
 
power
 
supplies.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
Got
 
it.
 
That's
 
really
 
helpful.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
are
 
engaged
 
in
 
about
 
200
 
electric
 
vehicle
 
projects
 
or
 
wins.
 
Could
 
you
 
go
 
over
 
maybe
 
kind
 
of
 
the
 
wins
 
or
 
pipeline
 
by
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
versus
 
gallium
 
nitride?
 
And
 
then
 
is
 
it
 
fair
 
to
 
assume
 
that
 
most
 
of
 
those
 
--
 
pretty
 
much
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
still
 
in
 
the
 
DC
 
--
 
DC-DC
 
converter
 
for
 
now?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
good
 
question.
 
Silicon
 
carbide
 
has
 
been
 
the
 
biggest
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
flow.
 
That's
 
what's
 
most
 
commonly
 
used.
 
If
 
you're
 
an
 
800
 
volt
 
battery
 
car,
 
you're
 
pretty
 
much
 
exclusively
 
going
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
If
 
you're
 
400
 
volts,
 
you
 
start
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
option
 
between
 
the
 
2.
 
Now
 
that
 
Navitas
 
has
 
GaNSafe,
 
it
 
becomes
 
a
 
very
 
viable
 
option.
 
But
 
I'd
 
say
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
EV
 
pipeline
 
is
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
oriented.
 
Today,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
strategic
 
focus
 
on
 
onboard
 
chargers,
 
which
 
includes
 
the
 
charging
 
of
 
the
 
battery
 
OBC,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
discharging
 
in
 
the
 
DC
 
to
 
DC
 
converter,
 
as
 
you
 
implied.
 
We're
 
also
 
taking
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
traction
 
inverters,
 
traction
 
motors.
 
So
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
hear
 
more
 
and
 
more
 
about
 
that
 
step-by-step
 
from
 
us
 
and
 
what
 
role
 
we
 
can
 
play
 
on
 
that
 
EV
 
electric
 
motor
 
or
 
traction
 
motor.
 
And
 
the
 
third
 
category
 
to
 
not
 
forget
 
about
 
is
 
roadside
 
chargers.
 
That's
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
and
 
exciting
 
opportunity,
 
today,
 
most
 
chargers
 
are
 
100
 
kilowatts,
 
50
 
kilowatts.
 
Tesla
 
is
 
leading
 
the
 
charge
 
at
 
350
 
kilowatts.
 
We're
 
working
 
with
 
customers
 
to
 
push
 
that
 
to
 
400,
 
500,
 
even
 
1
 
megawatt
 
is
 
not
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
question.
 
And
 
that's
 
entirely
 
100%
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
focus.
 
So
 
you
 
kind
 
of
 
look
 
at
 
in
 
those
 
3
 
buckets
 
with
 
a
 
majority
 
towards
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
as
 
I
 
described.
 
Operator
 
Your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
with
 
Rosenblatt.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
Congratulations
 
on
 
the
 
good
 
results.
 
Last
 
quarter,
 
you
 
had
 
named
 
--
 
you
 
had
 
3
 
data
 
center
 
design
 
wins
 
and
 
30
 
in
 
the
 
pipeline.
 
You
 
said
 
that
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
drive
 
$10
 
million
 
to
 
$20
 
million
 
in
 
2025.
 
Are
 
these
 
new
 
wins?
 
Is
 
this
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
additive
 
to
 
that,
 
or
 
were
 
you
 
kind
 
of
 
including
 
that
 
in
 
the
 
entire
 
pipeline?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
We
 
certainly
 
expected
 
the
 
pipeline
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
grow
 
from
 
the
 
30,
 
jumping
 
up
 
to
 
and
 
60
 
is
 
maybe
 
a
 
little
 
better
 
than
 
we
 
expected,
 
but
 
not
 
totally
 
out
 
of
 
line.
 
So
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
change
 
any
 
expectation
 
or
 
guidance
 
for
 
next
 
year.
 
It'll
 
certainly
 
be
 
very
 
material
 
and
 
a
 
significant
 
ramp
 
for
 
next
 
year.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
Okay.
 
Maybe
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
talk
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
the
 
competitive
 
landscape,
 
because
 
the
 
data
 
centers
 
are
 
screening
 
for
 
more
 
power
 
and
 
more
 
efficient
 
power.
 
And
 
it
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
attracting
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
competition.
 
Can
 
you
 
say
 
how
 
of
 
your
 
--
 
if
 
you've
 
got
 
60
 
design
 
wins,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
an
 
idea
 
of
 
what
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
designs
 
that
 
are
 
happening
 
that
 
would
 
be?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
The
 
60
 
is
 
the
 
total
 
customer
 
opportunities
 
in
 
the
 
pipeline.
 
Not
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
converted
 
to
 
wins,
 
let
 
alone,
 
of
 
course,
 
revenue,
 
which
 
takes
 
time.
 
But
 
competitively,
 
when
 
you
 
go
 
to
 
higher
 
power,
 
it's
 
actually
 
even
 
more
 
challenging
 
to
 
use
 
discrete
 
GaN
 
in
 
these
 
very
 
high
 
current,
 
high
 
power,
 
high
 
temperature
 
environments.
 
So
 
our
 
GaN
 
IC,
 
specifically
 
GaNSafe,
 
brings
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
value.
 
Also,
 
if
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
discrete
 
GaN,
 
is
 
unprotected
 
GaN,
 
you
 
go
 
into
 
these
 
high
 
power
 
applications,
 
they
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
last
 
10
 
to
 
20
 
years
 
lifetime.
 
And
 
GaNs,
 
the
 
new
 
kid
 
on
 
the
 
block,
 
it's
 
a
 
new
 
technology,
 
it's
 
unproven
 
in
 
these
 
high
 
power
 
applications,
 
which
 
is
 
why
 
we
 
took
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
integrate
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
protection,
 
reliability
 
circuits,
 
calling
 
it
 
the
 
safest
 
and
 
most
 
protected
 
GaN
 
in
 
the
 
world.
 
So
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
gives
 
us
 
significant
 
competitive
 
advantage.
 
Not
 
to
 
say
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
win
 
everything.
 
And
 
there
 
is
 
competition.
 
You
 
can
 
debate
 
silicon
 
versus
 
discrete
 
GaN
 
versus
 
our
 
GaN
 
ICs
 
or
 
GaNSafe.
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
being
 
used
 
increasingly
 
in
 
the
 
PFC
 
circuit,
 
where
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
do
 
really
 
well
 
there.
 
So
 
there's
 
certainly
 
competition.
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
the
 
landscape
 
has
 
changed.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
step-by-step,
 
you'll
 
see
 
strong
 
wins
 
and
 
strong
 
market
 
share
 
from
 
Navitas.
 
Especially
 
having
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
GaNSafe
 
for
 
that
 
second
 
stage
 
that
 
I
 
talked
 
about,
 
our
 
generation
 
3
 
Fast
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
For
 
the
 
first
 
stage,
 
and,
 
of
 
course,
 
to
 
bring
 
the
 
system
 
design
 
center,
 
which
 
helps
 
our
 
customers
 
speed
 
their
 
time
 
to
 
market,
 
but
 
also
 
get
 
the
 
most
 
out
 
of
 
these
 
technologies
 
to
 
maximize
 
that
 
power
 
density
 
and
 
efficiency.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
all
 
of
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
play
 
well.
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
any
 
major
 
change
 
to
 
the
 
competitive
 
landscape.
 
Operator
 
Your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Joe
 
Moore
 
with
 
Morgan
 
Stanley.
 
Joseph
 
Moore
 
I
 
guess
 
following
 
up
 
on
 
the
 
data
 
center.
 
When
 
you
 
talk
 
about
 
customers,
 
is
 
it
 
--
 
are
 
you
 
working
 
with
 
hyperscalers,
 
ODMs?
 
Is
 
it
 
the
 
chip
 
providers?
 
Just
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
who
 
the
 
partner
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
work
 
with
 
on
 
that.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Definitely,
 
Joe.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
So
 
we
 
ship
 
into
 
the
 
power
 
supply
 
makers,
 
those
 
are
 
predominantly
 
in
 
Taiwan
 
and
 
China,
 
companies
 
like
 
LITEON,
 
Delta,
 
AcBel,
 
Chicony,
 
Compuware
 
and
 
many
 
others.
 
Those
 
power
 
supply
 
companies
 
then
 
take
 
that
 
power
 
supply
 
and
 
ship
 
it
 
into
 
the
 
guys
 
who
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
system
 
integration
 
at
 
the
 
rack
 
level
 
and
 
then
 
ultimately
 
go
 
into
 
the
 
hyperscalers
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
data
 
center
 
sort
 
of
 
aggregator.
 
So
 
there's
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
steps
 
in
 
the
 
process,
 
but
 
that's
 
the
 
flow.
 
Increasingly
 
we're
 
talking
 
directly
 
to
 
AWS
 
and
 
Alibaba
 
and
 
Google,
 
Azure
 
and
 
NVIDIA
 
themselves
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
we
 
understand
 
those
 
future
 
power
 
requirements.
 
And
 
I
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
call
 
that
 
we're
 
marching
 
towards
 
really
 
a
 
doubling
 
of
 
that
 
rack
 
power,
 
60
 
to
 
120
 
to
 
240
 
to
 
[
 
480.
 
]
 
Probably
 
that
 
keeps
 
going.
 
And
 
those
 
comments
 
are
 
coming
 
from
 
what
 
we're
 
learning
 
about
 
the
 
future
 
system
 
requirements
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
our
 
design
 
center
 
and
 
those
 
power
 
supply
 
companies
 
that
 
I
 
mentioned
 
over
 
in
 
Asia
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
get
 
ahead
 
of
 
that
 
curve,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
easy,
 
but
 
clearly
 
that's
 
the
 
goal.
 
Joseph
 
Moore
 
Okay,
 
great.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
just
 
talked
 
about
 
competition
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
data
 
center,
 
but
 
can
 
you
 
talk
 
more
 
generally
 
competition
 
in
 
GaN?
 
Are
 
you
 
seeing
 
anything
 
from
 
China,
 
the
 
bigger
 
powering
 
companies
 
who
 
have
 
done
 
acquisitions
 
in
 
GaN?
 
Just
 
anything
 
changed
 
in
 
the
 
competitive
 
dynamic
 
from
 
who
 
you're
 
competing
 
against?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
My
 
comments
 
about
 
GaN
 
and
 
higher
 
power
 
GaN,
 
it
 
apply
 
broadly
 
to
 
each
 
of
 
these
 
higher
 
power
 
segments,
 
whether
 
it's
 
data
 
center,
 
EV,
 
solar,
 
even
 
appliance
 
industrial,
 
where
 
discrete
 
GaN
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
increasingly
 
challenged
 
due
 
to
 
reliability
 
concerns,
 
complexity,
 
and
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
most
 
performance
 
out
 
of
 
it.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
plays
 
well
 
for
 
our
 
GaNSafe's
 
technology.
 
Also
 
something
 
we
 
didn't
 
talk
 
about
 
this
 
time
 
but
 
did
 
last
 
quarter
 
was
 
bidirectional
 
GaN.
 
That's
 
opening
 
up
 
all
 
new
 
applications
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
higher
 
power
 
industrial
 
areas.
 
That's
 
even
 
more
 
differentiated
 
than
 
discrete
 
GaN.
 
So
 
again,
 
no
 
change
 
in
 
the
 
competitive
 
landscape.
 
I
 
just
 
think
 
as
 
we
 
get
 
more
 
and
 
more
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
with
 
our
 
GaNSafe
 
ICs
 
and
 
then
 
bidirectional
 
GaN,
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
strengthen
 
our
 
position
 
and
 
wins.
 
Operator
 
Your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jon
 
Tanwanteng
 
with
 
CJS
 
Securities.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
Gene,
 
I
 
get
 
the
 
design
 
momentum
 
and
 
the
 
no
 
real
 
pushouts
 
commentary
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
swing
 
factor
 
may
 
be
 
customer
 
production
 
volumes.
 
But
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
if
 
you
 
get
 
--
 
give
 
a
 
little
 
more
 
color
 
on
 
which
 
end
 
markets
 
are
 
maybe
 
feeling
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
uncertainty
 
or
 
maybe
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
urgency
 
to
 
get
 
products
 
out.
 
What's
 
--
 
where
 
are
 
the
 
deltas
 
and
 
the
 
momentum,
 
or
 
maybe
 
lack
 
of
 
momentum
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
forward?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Definitely,
 
Jon.
 
And
 
I
 
mentioned
 
that
 
while
 
we're
 
seeing
 
some
 
nice
 
upsides
 
in
 
the
 
mobile
 
consumer,
 
we
 
also
 
mentioned
 
how
 
notebooks
 
has
 
sort
 
of
 
firmed
 
up
 
and
 
got
 
some
 
nice
 
wins
 
there.
 
I
 
still
 
say
 
solar
 
is
 
the
 
area.
 
If
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
kind
 
of
 
percentage
 
of
 
revenue,
 
percentage
 
of
 
pipeline,
 
it's
 
solar.
 
That
 
still
 
seems
 
softer
 
than
 
the
 
other,
 
let's
 
say
 
EV
 
and
 
industrial.
 
As
 
much
 
as
 
the
 
growth
 
rate
 
came
 
down
 
earlier
 
in
 
the
 
year,
 
as
 
many
 
others
 
commented
 
on
 
--
 
those
 
seem
 
pretty
 
stable
 
as
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
revenue
 
and
 
pipeline.
 
The
 
one
 
positive
 
in
 
solar,
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned,
 
is
 
of
 
course,
 
GaN
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time
 
going
 
into
 
microinverters
 
next
 
year,
 
that
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
committed,
 
stable,
 
on
 
schedule
 
program.
 
So
 
those
 
are
 
how
 
I
 
see
 
sort
 
of
 
the
 
pluses
 
and
 
minuses
 
across
 
those
 
markets.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
Got
 
it.
 
And
 
maybe
 
you
 
could
 
address
 
the
 
AI
 
market
 
or
 
the
 
data
 
center
 
market
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more.
 
There's
 
been
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
recent
 
investor
 
consternation
 
over
 
capital
 
spending
 
and
 
returns,
 
and
 
there's
 
been
 
rumors
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
of
 
chip
 
delays.
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
if
 
any
 
of
 
that
 
filters
 
down
 
to
 
you
 
into
 
your
 
conversation
 
with
 
your
 
customers.
 
And
 
now
 
that
 
you're
 
talking
 
to
 
the
 
end
 
users
 
like
 
AWS
 
that
 
have
 
they
 
told
 
you
 
kinds
 
of
 
the
 
volumes
 
that
 
you
 
should
 
be
 
expecting
 
down
 
the
 
pipeline
 
or
 
what
 
kind
 
of
 
disruptions
 
there
 
might
 
be
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
delay?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
Tanwanteng,
 
I'm
 
glad
 
you
 
brought
 
up
 
like
 
cost
 
to
 
capital,
 
because
 
that
 
complicated
 
sort
 
of
 
supply
 
chain,
 
or
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
steps
 
from
 
going
 
to
 
chip
 
to
 
power
 
supply
 
to
 
rack
 
to
 
integrator
 
to
 
hyperscaler,
 
actually
 
it's
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
a
 
challenge
 
for
 
us.
 
One,
 
we
 
got
 
to
 
anticipate
 
the
 
future
 
power
 
requirements
 
that
 
we
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
connect
 
down
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.
 
Also
 
another
 
benefit
 
I
 
didn't
 
even
 
bring
 
up
 
earlier
 
about
 
trying
 
to
 
pack
 
more
 
power
 
in
 
smaller
 
size,
 
due
 
to
 
switching
 
speed
 
and
 
efficiency.
 
The
 
other
 
one
 
is
 
when
 
you
 
get
 
higher
 
efficiency,
 
you
 
start
 
reducing
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
electricity
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
center.
 
Those
 
numbers
 
are
 
actually
 
pretty
 
big.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
start
 
reducing
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
cooling
 
the
 
data
 
center.
 
Those
 
are
 
the
 
second
 
biggest
 
expensive
 
things.
 
And
 
right
 
now,
 
we
 
feel
 
like
 
we're
 
not
 
getting
 
paid
 
for
 
those
 
benefits
 
at
 
the
 
power
 
supply
 
guys,
 
because
 
they're
 
trying
 
to
 
ship
 
a
 
power
 
supply
 
at
 
the
 
--
 
just
 
keep
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
power
 
density
 
requirement.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
there's
 
real
 
opportunity
 
better
 
articulate
 
and
 
help
 
the
 
down
 
the
 
line
 
hyperscalers
 
and
 
the
 
rack
 
integrators
 
to
 
truly
 
understand
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
electricity
 
benefits,
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
thermal
 
benefits.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
that'll
 
all
 
come
 
out
 
over
 
time.
 
But
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
new
 
field,
 
GaN,
 
it's
 
a
 
new
 
technology,
 
and
 
we're
 
still
 
kind
 
of
 
getting
 
that
 
message
 
out
 
and
 
building
 
a
 
deeper
 
understanding
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
value
 
throughout
 
that
 
supply
 
chain.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
Is
 
it
 
fair
 
to
 
say
 
as
 
you
 
go
 
into
 
these
 
higher
 
kilowatts
 
per
 
rack,
 
where
 
maybe
 
the
 
competition
 
won't
 
be
 
as
 
able
 
to
 
keep
 
up
 
that
 
you
 
could
 
conceivably
 
charge
 
a
 
higher
 
margin
 
for
 
[Technical
 
Difficulty]
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
we
 
do.
 
In
 
fact,
 
if
 
anything,
 
when
 
we
 
talk
 
to
 
these
 
guys,
 
they're
 
like,
 
don't
 
worry
 
about
 
the
 
cost.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
efficiency.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
thermals.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
power.
 
Now,
 
they're
 
not
 
the
 
guys
 
buying
 
the
 
power
 
supply.
 
They're
 
down
 
--
 
down
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.
 
But
 
still
 
that
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
their
 
obsession.
 
So
 
this
 
adds
 
to
 
our
 
confidence
 
that
 
we've
 
got
 
real
 
value
 
here.
 
That
 
value
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
grow
 
over
 
time.
 
It'll
 
help
 
us
 
with
 
our
 
long-term
 
margin
 
expectations,
 
of
 
course,
 
as
 
we
 
said
 
earlier.
 
But
 
we
 
got
 
to
 
get
 
that
 
message
 
out
 
throughout
 
the
 
entire
 
supply
 
chain.

Your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
with
 
[
 
Craig-Hallum.

Richard
 
Shannon
 
Most
 
of
 
mine
 
have
 
been
 
answered
 
here.
 
But
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
was
 
interesting
 
here,
 
Gene,
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
conference
 
call,
 
you
 
talked
 
about
 
this
 
new

called
 
GaNSlim.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
said,
 
you
 
had
 
20
 
projects.
 
Now,
 
in
 
the
 
press
 
release
 
today,
 
you
 
said
 
you
 
got
 
50,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
pretty
 
big
 
pickup,
 
although
 
I
 
see
 
it's
 
mostly
 
mobile
 
consumers.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
why
 
you're
 
picking
 
up
 
pretty
 
fast
 
there.
 
But
 
I
 
guess
 
my
 
question
 
is,
 
how
 
fast
 
do
 
you
 
expect
 
that
 
to
 
take
 
over
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
interest
 
from
 
that
 
consumer
 
and
 
mobile
 
market?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
bringing
 
it
 
up.
 
We
 
didn't
 
put
 
a
 
big
 
spotlight
 
on
 
it
 
with
 
everything
 
else
 
going
 
on.
 
And
 
you're
 
exactly
 
right.
 
We
 
see
 
GaNSlim
 
taking
 
up
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
--
 
creating
 
all
 
new
 
opportunities,
 
even
 
more
 
price
 
sensitive
 
ones.
 
It's
 
now
 
clearly
 
more
 
cost
 
effective
 
than
 
silicon
 
at
 
the
 
system
 
level.
 
That's
 
opening
 
up
 
not
 
just
 
mobile
 
opportunities,
 
but
 
consumer
 
opportunities.
 
I
 
didn't
 
put
 
much
 
emphasis
 
on
 
appliances,
 
just
 
because
 
that
 
takes
 
longer.
 
But
 
it's
 
definitely
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
going
 
in
 
there
 
and
 
accelerating
 
the
 
appliance
 
sector,
 
which
 
is
 
already
 
growing
 
pretty
 
strongly
 
with
 
those
 
25
 
new
 
wins.
 
So,
 
yes,
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
hit
 
on
 
it
 
correctly.
 
GaNSlim
 
is
 
really
 
promising.
 
It's
 
opening
 
up
 
new
 
markets,
 
helping
 
us
 
grow
 
share
 
in
 
the
 
existing
 
mobile
 
markets.
 
And
 
all
 
those
 
markets
 
are
 
under
 
500
 
watts,
 
right?
 
So
 
there's
 
kind
 
of
 
no
 
limit
 
to
 
where
 
it
 
could
 
go.
 
500
 
watts
 
is
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
power,
 
fast
 
charging
 
or
 
even
 
powering
 
your
 
TV,
 
even
 
powering
 
LED
 
lights.
 
So
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
applications
 
out
 
there
 
across
 
mobile
 
and
 
consumer
 
that
 
are
 
sub
 
500
 
watts
 
and
 
a
 
good
 
target
 
for
 
GaNSlim.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
helpful
 
perspective,
 
Gene.
 
My
 
last
 
question
 
here
 
is
 
on
 
mobile.
 
I've
 
asked
 
this,
 
I
 
think
 
many
 
people
 
have
 
asked
 
this
 
question
 
over
 
the
 
years
 
or
 
quarters
 
you've
 
been
 
doing
 
calls
 
here.
 
But
 
curious
 
as
 
you
 
have
 
seen
 
an
 
increased
 
attach
 
rate
 
through
 
chargers
 
here
 
and
 
then
 
getting
 
any
 
visibility
 
as
 
you
 
go
 
into
 
next
 
year
 
with
 
major
 
phone
 
introductions
 
moving
 
up
 
the
 
charger
 
power
 
curve,
 
getting
 
above
 
that
 
level
 
that
 
you
 
think
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
breakpoint
 
for,
 
again,
 
adoption.
 
Getting
 
in
 
more
 
visibility
 
into
 
that
 
as
 
you
 
get
 
into
 
next
 
year.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
bringing
 
it
 
up,
 
Richard.
 
We've
 
talked
 
a
 
lot
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
about
 
65
 
watts
 
and
 
up,
 
being
 
kind
 
of
 
that
 
sweet
 
spot.
 
When
 
you're
 
down
 
around
 
20
 
watts,
 
30
 
watts,
 
it's
 
mostly
 
plastic
 
in
 
case
 
it's
 
already
 
pretty
 
small.
 
So
 
there's
 
not
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
leverage
 
for
 
GaN.
 
You
 
can
 
do
 
it,
 
but
 
you're
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
cost
 
play
 
at
 
that
 
point.
 
So
 
we're
 
obviously
 
very
 
focused
 
on
 
value
 
and
 
improving
 
that
 
consumer
 
experience.
 
65
 
watts
 
is
 
very
 
fast
 
charging
 
for
 
a
 
phone
 
and
 
actually
 
quite
 
fast
 
charging
 
for
 
a
 
tablet
 
or
 
a
 
laptop.
 
If
 
you
 
look
 
across
 
the
 
major
 
players
 
out
 
there,
 
it's
 
the
 
Chinese,
 
Oppo,
 
Xiaomi,
 
Vivo,
 
and
 
others
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
super
 
aggressive
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
65
 
watts
 
and
 
higher,
 
100
 
watt.
 
We
 
even
 
talked
 
about
 
200
 
watts
 
to
 
fast
 
charge
 
a
 
phone,
 
which
 
is
 
easy,
 
fast,
 
0%
 
to
 
100%
 
in
 
9
 
minutes.
 
So
 
these
 
are
 
crazy
 
numbers,
 
but
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
believe
 
those
 
are
 
an
 
indication
 
of
 
where
 
the
 
whole
 
industry
 
is
 
going.
 
There's
 
no
 
reason
 
that
 
China
 
suppliers
 
in
 
particular
 
would
 
be
 
at
 
these
 
higher
 
power
 
levels
 
and
 
others
 
wouldn't.
 
I
 
think
 
others
 
have
 
their
 
own
 
roadmaps.
 
They
 
have
 
their
 
own
 
sort
 
of
 
conservative
 
approach
 
to
 
product
 
development.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
those
 
are
 
coming.
 
If
 
you
 
look
 
across
 
the
 
Koreans
 
and
 
the
 
American
 
players,
 
they're
 
now
 
pushing
 
mainstream
 
in
 
the
 
45
 
watt
 
range,
 
30
 
watt
 
range,
 
which
 
means
 
you're
 
just
 
a
 
step
 
or
 
2
 
away
 
from
 
that
 
65
 
watt
 
tipping
 
point,
 
if
 
you
 
will.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
see
 
that
 
the
 
trends
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
continue.
 
Everything
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
keep
 
going
 
up
 
into
 
that
 
65
 
watt
 
and
 
higher
 
range.
 
And
 
ultimately,
 
we're
 
not
 
done
 
until
 
the
 
consumer
 
can
 
really
 
superfast
 
charge
 
all
 
your
 
devices
 
from
 
one
 
tiny
 
--
 
100
 
watt,
 
200
 
watts
 
multiport
 
charger.
 
Operator
 
And
 
your
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
with
 
Charter
 
Equity
 
Research.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
I
 
just
 
had
 
one.
 
So
 
on
 
the
 
expansion
 
of
 
the
 
internal
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
epi
 
capacity,
 
given
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
lower
 
expectations
 
just
 
for
 
the
 
overall
 
SiC
 
TAM
 
growth
 
this
 
year,
 
have
 
you
 
guys
 
adjusted
 
kind
 
of
 
the
 
pace
 
of
 
your
 
expansion
 
at
 
all,
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
still
 
just
 
going
 
full
 
steam
 
ahead
 
with
 
the
 
internal
 
epi?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
No,
 
you're
 
exactly
 
right,
 
Jack.
 
With
 
the
 
markets
 
adjusting
 
for
 
slower
 
growth
 
rates,
 
there
 
was
 
not
 
the
 
pressing,
 
immediate
 
need
 
to
 
bring
 
that
 
first
 
reactor
 
online.
 
So
 
we
 
put
 
it
 
on
 
hold.
 
We
 
expect
 
to
 
bring
 
it
 
online
 
next
 
year
 
when
 
we
 
can
 
ramp
 
it
 
and
 
get
 
those
 
cost
 
and
 
margin
 
enhancement
 
benefits
 
we
 
talked
 
about.
 
When
 
we
 
originally
 
announced
 
a
 
$20
 
million
 
strategic
 
manufacturing
 
investments
 
over
 
3
 
years,
 
it
 
was
 
sort
 
of
 
one
 
reactor
 
a
 
year.
 
So
 
probably
 
fair
 
to
 
say
 
you
 
can
 
assume
 
that
 
plan
 
has
 
shifted
 
by
 
about
 
1
 
year
 
based
 
upon
 
the
 
market
 
outlook
 
and
 
the
 
market
 
need.
 
Operator
 
Ladies
 
and
 
gentlemen,
 
that
 
concludes
 
our
 
Q&A
 
session
 
and
 
today's
 
call.
 
Thank
 
you
 
all
 
for
 
joining.
 
You
 
may
 
now
 
disconnect.
