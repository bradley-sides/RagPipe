section
 
of
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile's
 
annual
 
report
 
on
 
Form
 
10-K
 
for
 
the
 
year
 
that
 
ended
 
December
 
31,
 
2024,
 
with
 
the
 
Securities
 
and
 
Exchange
 
Commission
 
and
 
other
 
documents
 
ﬁled
 
by
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
with
 
the
 
SEC
 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time.
 
Also,
 
after
 
our
 
initial
 
remarks,
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
starting
 
our
 
Q&A
 
section
 
with
 
questions
 
submitted
 
by
 
our
 
shareholders.
 
For
 
those
 
of
 
you
 
who
 
may
 
be
 
new
 
to
 
our
 
company
 
and
 
mission,
 
there
 
are
 
over
 
5
 
billion
 
mobile
 
phones
 
in
 
use
 
today
 
around
 
the
 
world,
 
but
 
many
 
of
 
us
 
still
 
experience
 
gaps
 
in
 
coverage
 
as
 
we
 
live,
 
work
 
and
 
travel.
 
Additionally,
 
there
 
are
 
billions
 
of
 
people
 
without
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
and
 
who
 
remain
 
unconnected
 
to
 
the
 
global
 
economy.
 
The
 
markets
 
we
 
are
 
pursuing
 
are
 
massive
 
and
 
the
 
problem
 
we
 
are
 
solving
 
is
 
important
 
and
 
touches
 
nearly
 
all
 
of
 
us.
 
In
 
this
 
backdrop,
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
is
 
building
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
and
 
only
 
global
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
network
 
in
 
space
 
to
 
operate
 
directly
 
with
 
everyday
 
unmodiﬁed
 
mobile
 
devices
 
and
 
supported
 
by
 
our
 
extensive
 
IP
 
and
 
patent
 
portfolio.
 
It's
 
now
 
my
 
pleasure
 
to
 
pass
 
over
 
to
 
Chairman
 
and
 
CEO,
 
Abel
 
Avellan,
 
who
 
will
 
give
 
us
 
an
 
update
 
on
 
our
 
activities
 
since
 
our
 
last
 
public
 
call
 
2
 
months
 
ago.
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Scott.
 
The
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
was
 
a
 
strong
 
start
 
for
 
us,
 
and
 
we're
 
currently
 
in
 
an
 
incredible
 
inﬂection
 
point
 
for
 
the
 
company
 
as
 
we
 
start
 
to
 
accelerate
 
the
 
launch
 
and
 
scaling
 
of
 
our
 
network
 
and
 
revenue
 
is
 
starting
 
to
 
come
 
in.
 
We
 
continue
 
executing
 
on
 
satellite
 
manufacturing,
 
commercialization,
 
regulatory
 
initiatives.
 
And
 
today,
 
we
 
are
 
unveiling
 
our
 
orbital
 
launch
 
plan
 
with
 
5
 
scheduled
 
launches
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
6
 
to
 
9
 
months.
 
I
 
will
 
touch
 
on
 
each
 
of
 
those
 
key
 
pieces
 
in
 
more
 
detail.
 
Let
 
me
 
start
 
by
 
discussing
 
our
 
orbital
 
launch
 
schedule.
 
We
 
expect
 
to
 
deploy
 
over
 
60
 
satellites
 
during
 
'25
 
and
 
'26,
 
which
 
will
 
drive
 
continuous
 
coverage
 
in
 
key
 
markets
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
Europe,
 
Japan,
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government
 
and
 
other
 
strategic
 
markets.
 
We
 
anticipate
 
5
 
orbital
 
launches
 
occurring
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
6
 
to
 
9
 
months,
 
with
 
orbital
 
launches
 
occurring
 
every
 
1
 
to
 
2
 
months
 
on
 
average
 
during
 
'25
 
and
 
'26.
 
Our
 
campaign
 
will
 
begin
 
with
 
the
 
achievement
 
of
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
in
 
Q2
 
with
 
launches
 
scheduled
 
during
 
July.
 
Simply
 
put,
 
speed
 
to
 
orbit
 
means
 
speed
 
to
 
commercial
 
service.
 
Scaling
 
our
 
constellation
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
delivering
 
on
 
the
 
global
 
opportunity
 
of
 
providing
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
connectivity
 
to
 
the
 
modiﬁed
 
phone
 
in
 
your
 
pocket
 
today.
 
Satellite
 
manufacturing
 
remains
 
on
 
track,
 
accelerating
 
our
 
target
 
of
 
building
 
40
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellite,
 
each
 
the
 
largest
 
ever
 
commercial
 
communication
 
satellite
 
low
 
earth
 
orbit
 
alongside
 
contracted
 
orbit
 
launches
 
for
 
every
 
60
 
satellites
 
as
 
of
 
today.
 
We
 
have
 
accelerated
 
our
 
manufacturing
 
eﬀorts
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
move
 
at
 
the
 
rapid
 
speed
 
to
 
reach
 
our
 
goals.
 
Scaling
 
our
 
satellite
 
manufacturing
 
will
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
match
 
or
 
exceed
 
the
 
launch
 
cadence
 
necessary
 
to
 
build
 
out
 
our
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
network
 
for
 
continued
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
coverage
 
beginning
 
with
 
the
 
key
 
markets
 
mentioned
 
earlier.
 
In
 
doing
 
so,
 
we're
 
also
 
on
 
track
 
to
 
reach
 
manufacturing
 
cadence
 
of
 
6
 
satellites
 
per
 
month
 
during
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
this
 
year.
 
We
 
also
 
expect
 
to
 
reach
 
an
 
equivalent
 
manufacturing
 
cadence
 
for
 
our
 
microns
 
and
 
phased
 
array
 
production
 
during
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
of
 
this
 
year.
 
We
 
expect
 
to
 
achieve
 
this
 
cadence
 
through
 
our
 
expanded
 
global
 
footprint,
 
streamlined
 
process
 
and
 
95%
 
vertical
 
integration
 
strategy.
 
Our
 
content
 
manufacturing
 
house
 
or
 
through
 
third
 
parties
 
using
 
own
 
intellectual
 
property
 
help
 
drive
 
speed,
 
certainty,
 
lower
 
cost,
 
ﬂexibility
 
and
 
reliability.
 
Speciﬁcally,
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
our
 
microns
 
or
 
main
 
building
 
blocks
 
for
 
our
 
satellites
 
are
 
fully
 
vertically
 
integrated
 
within
 
our
 
manufacturing
 
ecosystem.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
extremely
 
important
 
process,
 
which
 
have
 
helped
 
right
 
size
 
our
 
lines
 
of
 
production
 
and
 
have
 
enabled
 
us
 
to
 
operate
 
with
 
complete
 
control
 
over
 
the
 
entire
 
micron
 
production
 
process.
 
Now
 
that
 
our
 
satellite
 
manufacturing
 
cadence
 
and
 
accelerated
 
production
 
eﬀorts
 
support
 
our
 
launch
 
schedule,
 
we're
 
now
 
conﬁdent
 
than
 
ever
 
--
 
we're
 
now
 
more
 
conﬁdent
 
than
 
ever
 
in
 
our
 
position
 
to
 
continue
 
executing
 
at
 
scale
 
as
 
we
 
lead
 
the
 
industry
 
with
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
from
 
the
 
space.
 
On
 
the
 
ASIC
 
front,
 
our
 
novel
 
ASIC
 
chip
 
are
 
currently
 
undergoing
 
assembly
 
and
 
testing
 
stages,
 
while
 
the
 
validation
 
and
 
qualiﬁcation
 
stages
 
are
 
nearing
 
completion.
 
We
 
expect
 
our
 
ASIC
 
chip
 
will
 
become
 
available
 
for
 
satellite
 
integration
 
as
 
early
 
as
 
June
 
of
 
this
 
year.
 
As
 
you
 
will
 
recall,
 
our
 
custom
 
ASIC
 
chip
 
will
 
support
 
up
 
to
 
10
 
gigahertz
 
in
 
processing
 
bandwidth
 
per
 
satellite
 
or
 
10x
 
the
 
processing
 
compared
 
to
 
our
 
current
 
FPGAs
 
with
 
peak
 
data
 
speeds
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
120
 
megabits
 
per
 
cell,
 
supporting
 
many
 
thousands
 
of
 
cells
 
per
 
satellite,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
enabler
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
and
 
only
 
space-based
 
broadband
 
cellular
 
system,
 
together
 
with
 
the
 
largest
 
ever
 
commercial
 
communication
 
satellites
 
in
 
low
 
earth
 
orbit.
 
On
 
the
 
commercial
 
front,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
integrate
 
our
 
services
 
with
 
our
 
MNO
 
partners.
 
Recently,
 
our
 
long-time
 
partner,
 
Rakuten
 
Mobile
 
completed
 
a
 
2-way
 
broadband
 
video
 
call
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
a
 
live
 
audience
 
enabled
 
by
 
Block
 
1
 
satellites
 
over
 
Japan.
 
The
 
call
 
was
 
conducted
 
using
 
unmodiﬁed
 
smartphones
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
our
 
initial
 
activation
 
in
 
the
 
country
 
and
 
following
 
successful
 
video
 
calls
 
with
 
partners
 
like
 
AT&T,
 
Verizon
 
and
 
Vodafone
 
in
 
United
 
States
 
and
 
Europe,
 
respectively.
 
The
 
live
 
activation
 
is
 
another
 
example
 
of
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
successfully
 
enable
 
full
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
capabilities,
 
including
 
voice,
 
text,
 
data,
 
video
 
and
 
other
 
native
 
cellular
 
capabilities.
 
Japan
 
is
 
a
 
country
 
deﬁned
 
by
 
its
 
diverse
 
geography,
 
prone
 
to
 
national
 
disasters.
 
Being
 
able
 
to
 
provide
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
service
 
direct
 
to
 
device
 
over
 
the
 
country,
 
mountains
 
region,
 
remote
 
islands
 
and
 
densely
 
populated
 
cities
 
during
 
routine
 
and
 
emergency
 
situations
 
are
 
transformational
 
applications
 
for
 
our
 
groundbreaking
 
technology.
 
I
 
am
 
proud
 
of
 
our
 
company's
 
long
 
history
 
of
 
a
 
strategic
 
partnership
 
with
 
Rakuten.
 
I'm
 
excited
 
for
 
our
 
continued
 
progress
 
in
 
the
 
country.
 
Globally,
 
we
 
plan
 
to
 
activate
 
initial
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
capabilities
 
in
 
United
 
States,
 
Europe
 
and
 
Japan
 
on
 
premium
 
low-band
 
wireless
 
spectrum,
 
together
 
with
 
partners
 
AT&T,
 
Google,
 
Rakuten,
 
Verizon
 
and
 
Vodafone
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
other
 
players
 
in
 
the
 
wireless
 
ecosystem.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
step
 
for
 
initial
 
service
 
activation,
 
enabling
 
activation
 
across
 
several
 
key
 
markets
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
all
 
with
 
varying
 
geographic
 
and
 
demographic
 
factors,
 
provide
 
us
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
optimize
 
our
 
network
 
ahead
 
of
 
a
 
full
 
commercial
 
deployment.
 
We
 
also
 
received
 
a
 
special
 
temporary
 
authority
 
from
 
the
 
FCC
 
for
 
FirstNet
 
direct-to-device
 
satellite
 
connectivity
 
on
 
public
 
safety
 
band
 
14
 
spectrum.
 
The
 
FCC
 
grants
 
direct-to-device
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
connectivity
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
mission-critical
 
capabilities.
 
With
 
over
 
7
 
million
 
public
 
safety
 
connections,
 
FirstNet
 
network
 
gives
 
responders
 
the
 
critical
 
connectivity
 
they
 
need
 
across
 
diverse
 
geographies.
 
Our
 
groundbreaking
 
technology
 
stands
 
to
 
provide
 
ﬁrst
 
responders
 
with
 
reliable
 
and
 
consistent
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
connectivity
 
during
 
crucial
 
times
 
of
 
need.
 
On
 
the
 
government
 
business,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
expand
 
our
 
U.S.
 
government
 
opportunity
 
and
 
are
 
ramping
 
up
 
activity
 
against
 
our
 
$43
 
million
 
contract
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
Space
 
Development
 
Agency.
 
Even
 
more
 
recently,
 
we
 
signed
 
a
 
new
 
contract
 
award
 
with
 
another
 
government
 
agency
 
through
 
a
 
prime
 
contractor
 
to
 
provide
 
support
 
of
 
communications
 
over
 
land,
 
sea
 
and
 
air.
 
Scott
 
will
 
speak
 
more
 
to
 
our
 
new
 
contract
 
award
 
momentarily.
 
But
 
this
 
contract
 
award
 
highlights
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile's
 
innovative
 
technologies
 
to
 
back
 
critical
 
government
 
missions
 
across
 
various
 
use
 
cases,
 
both
 
for
 
communications
 
and
 
non-communications
 
applications.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
advanced
 
commercial
 
and
 
government
 
eﬀorts,
 
we're
 
working
 
closely
 
with
 
regulators
 
and
 
government
 
oﬃcials
 
who
 
recognize
 
that
 
our
 
technology
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
make
 
our
 
country
 
both
 
more
 
connected
 
and
 
more
 
secure.
 
In
 
summary,
 
all
 
key
 
elements
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
are
 
progressing
 
as
 
expected
 
or
 
have
 
accelerated
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
customer
 
demand
 
for
 
our
 
groundbreaking
 
technology.
 
The
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
was
 
a
 
period
 
of
 
strong
 
execution,
 
serving
 
as
 
a
 
springboard
 
into
 
another
 
pivotal
 
chapter
 
of
 
the
 
company's
 
life.
 
We
 
have
 
now
 
reached
 
an
 
inﬂection
 
point
 
as
 
we
 
scale
 
fundamental
 
aspects
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
towards
 
a
 
full-scale
 
commercialization.
 
With
 
our
 
launch
 
plan
 
outlined,
 
launch
 
capacity
 
secured,
 
and
 
commercial
 
and
 
government
 
partnerships
 
coming
 
together,
 
we
 
expect
 
positive
 
momentum
 
to
 
compound
 
at
 
record
 
speed
 
for
 
our
 
months
 
and
 
quarters
 
to
 
come.
 
Connectivity
 
is
 
a
 
human
 
right,
 
and
 
each
 
step
 
in
 
this
 
process
 
is
 
a
 
reminder
 
of
 
the
 
important
 
mission
 
at
 
hand.
 
Let
 
me
 
now
 
turn
 
the
 
call
 
to
 
Scott
 
to
 
provide
 
more
 
details
 
on
 
our
 
progress
 
and
 
initiatives.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Abel.
 
This
 
was
 
a
 
strong
 
start
 
to
 
the
 
year
 
for
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile,
 
and
 
we're
 
expecting
 
continued
 
progress
 
across
 
all
 
aspects
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
as
 
we
 
charge
 
into
 
a
 
pivotal
 
year
 
for
 
the
 
company.
 
Let
 
me
 
expand
 
upon
 
our
 
achievements
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
months
 
and
 
what
 
they
 
mean
 
for
 
the
 
commercialization
 
of
 
the
 
company.
 
Our
 
commercial
 
eﬀorts
 
are
 
accelerating,
 
and
 
we're
 
making
 
major
 
advancements
 
in
 
the
 
deployment
 
of
 
our
 
global
 
network
 
infrastructure,
 
beginning
 
with
 
bookings
 
of
 
our
 
gateway
 
equipment.
 
Gateways
 
served
 
as
 
a
 
precursor
 
to
 
the
 
rollout
 
of
 
our
 
SpaceMobile
 
Service,
 
providing
 
a
 
leading
 
indicator
 
of
 
the
 
markets
 
where
 
you'll
 
see
 
the
 
initial
 
service
 
revenue.
 
In
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter,
 
we
 
saw
 
gateway
 
equipment
 
bookings
 
of
 
$13.6
 
million
 
and
 
expect
 
continued
 
bookings
 
of
 
approximately
 
$10
 
million
 
on
 
average
 
per
 
quarter
 
during
 
2025.
 
We'll
 
begin
 
to
 
recognize
 
revenue
 
from
 
these
 
bookings
 
as
 
and
 
when
 
gateways
 
are
 
installed
 
and
 
milestones
 
are
 
met,
 
and
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
provide
 
updates
 
on
 
bookings
 
as
 
we
 
build
 
out
 
our
 
ground
 
infrastructure.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
our
 
network
 
infrastructure
 
was
 
designed
 
from
 
inception
 
to
 
closely
 
mirror
 
terrestrial
 
cellular
 
architecture,
 
prioritizing
 
privacy
 
and
 
security
 
of
 
cellular
 
data
 
and
 
information.
 
Our
 
ground-based
 
gateways
 
receive
 
signals
 
from
 
our
 
satellites,
 
each
 
the
 
largest
 
ever
 
commercially
 
deployed
 
communications
 
satellites
 
in
 
low
 
earth
 
orbit
 
and
 
seamlessly
 
link
 
those
 
signals
 
into
 
the
 
networks
 
of
 
our
 
mobile
 
operating
 
partners.
 
On
 
the
 
regulatory
 
front,
 
we
 
were
 
recently
 
granted
 
special
 
temporary
 
authority
 
from
 
the
 
FCC
 
for
 
FirstNet
 
on
 
public
 
safety's
 
Band
 
14
 
spectrum,
 
enabling
 
us
 
to
 
begin
 
activating
 
test
 
services
 
to
 
deliver
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
connectivity,
 
supporting
 
features
 
critical
 
to
 
ﬁrst
 
responders.
 
Through
 
initial
 
test
 
activation,
 
we're
 
now
 
able
 
to
 
address
 
the
 
massive
 
opportunity
 
of
 
extending
 
reliable
 
broadband
 
services
 
to
 
ﬁrst
 
responder
 
agencies
 
and
 
consumers
 
in
 
emergency
 
situations.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
across
 
areas
 
where
 
terrestrial
 
networks
 
are
 
unavailable
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
during
 
network
 
outages
 
caused
 
by
 
infrastructure
 
failures
 
or
 
natural
 
disasters.
 
Our
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
solution
 
provides
 
seamless
 
device
 
compatibility
 
and
 
our
 
satellites
 
enable
 
automatic
 
handoﬀs
 
as
 
consumers
 
move
 
in
 
and
 
out
 
of
 
terrestrial
 
networks.
 
Together,
 
this
 
provides
 
ﬁrst
 
responders
 
with
 
enhanced,
 
reliable
 
broadband
 
connectivity
 
during
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
situations
 
while
 
maintaining
 
the
 
look
 
and
 
feel
 
of
 
the
 
reliable
 
terrestrial
 
networks
 
that
 
they're
 
used
 
to.
 
The
 
sheer
 
size
 
of
 
our
 
satellites
 
is
 
another
 
beneﬁt
 
in
 
our
 
eﬀort
 
to
 
support
 
ﬁrst
 
responder
 
communications.
 
Our
 
large
 
antennas
 
enable
 
precise
 
beamforming,
 
meaning
 
we
 
can
 
focus
 
our
 
signals
 
on
 
speciﬁc
 
targeted
 
areas
 
over
 
land
 
and
 
water.
 
Emergencies
 
can
 
happen
 
anywhere
 
and
 
responders
 
need
 
to
 
stay
 
connected
 
across
 
both
 
accessible
 
and
 
hard-to-reach
 
areas
 
without
 
geographical
 
impediments.
 
Continuing
 
on
 
to
 
our
 
partnership
 
with
 
Vodafone,
 
I
 
am
 
also
 
pleased
 
to
 
report
 
that
 
our
 
jointly
 
owned
 
European
 
satellite
 
service
 
business,
 
called
 
SatCo
 
is
 
progressing
 
according
 
to
 
plan.
 
Now
 
to
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government
 
business.
 
Our
 
pipeline
 
continues
 
to
 
strengthen,
 
and
 
as
 
anticipated,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
expect
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
meaningful
 
contributor
 
to
 
revenue
 
in
 
the
 
years
 
to
 
come.
 
Our
 
recently
 
announced
 
contract
 
award
 
with
 
the
 
DIU,
 
a
 
government
 
agency
 
through
 
a
 
prime
 
contractor,
 
facilitates
 
initial
 
communication
 
services
 
across
 
various
 
use
 
cases
 
and
 
applications,
 
supporting
 
communications
 
over
 
land,
 
sea
 
and
 
air.
 
We
 
believe
 
this
 
contract
 
could
 
yield
 
low
 
tens
 
of
 
millions
 
of
 
dollars
 
in
 
revenue
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
to
 
18
 
months.
 
And
 
earlier
 
in
 
the
 
year,
 
we
 
also
 
signed
 
a
 
$43
 
million
 
revenue
 
contract
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Space
 
Development
 
Agency
 
through
 
a
 
prime
 
contractor
 
for
 
services
 
delivered
 
on
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
5
 
Block
 
1
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
in
 
orbit
 
and
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellite.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
that
 
contract
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
prepaid
 
contract,
 
but
 
rather
 
earned
 
revenue
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
receive
 
and
 
recognize
 
under
 
GAAP
 
as
 
we
 
deliver
 
those
 
services.
 
To
 
date,
 
our
 
government
 
contracts
 
serve
 
as
 
important
 
validation
 
markers
 
for
 
our
 
dual-use
 
satellite
 
technology,
 
opening
 
doors
 
to
 
sustained
 
and
 
substantial
 
revenue
 
streams
 
across
 
both
 
communications
 
and
 
non-communications
 
applications.
 
I
 
will
 
now
 
pass
 
it
 
over
 
to
 
Andy
 
to
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
ﬁnancial
 
update.
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
Thanks,
 
Scott,
 
and
 
good
 
afternoon,
 
everyone.
 
During
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025,
 
our
 
global
 
team
 
at
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
worked
 
tirelessly
 
to
 
accelerate
 
satellite
 
manufacturing
 
eﬀorts
 
as
 
we
 
prepare
 
to
 
commence
 
our
 
launch
 
campaign
 
beginning
 
this
 
summer.
 
The
 
company's
 
ﬁnancial
 
performance
 
during
 
Q1
 
reﬂects
 
our
 
intense
 
focus
 
on
 
executing
 
on
 
our
 
manufacturing
 
and
 
launch
 
objectives
 
while
 
simultaneously
 
preparing
 
for
 
a
 
meaningful
 
revenue
 
ramp
 
over
 
the
 
coming
 
periods
 
as
 
we
 
begin
 
to
 
monetize
 
both
 
commercial
 
and
 
government
 
opportunities
 
for
 
our
 
dual-use
 
satellites.
 
As
 
Abel
 
and
 
Scott
 
conveyed
 
in
 
their
 
earlier
 
remarks,
 
our
 
progress
 
against
 
corporate
 
objectives
 
in
 
Q1
 
positions
 
us
 
well
 
to
 
begin
 
executing
 
an
 
extensive
 
launch
 
cadence
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
oﬀering
 
our
 
SpaceMobile
 
service
 
while
 
continuing
 
to
 
facilitate
 
critical
 
U.S.
 
government
 
applications
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
national
 
security
 
eﬀorts.
 
We've
 
established
 
our
 
objective
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
the
 
next
 
40
 
satellites
 
and
 
are
 
thrilled
 
to
 
start
 
our
 
launch
 
campaign
 
featuring
 
at
 
least
 
5
 
scheduled
 
launches
 
between
 
Q2
 
of
 
2025
 
and
 
Q1
 
of
 
2026.
 
Our
 
focus
 
today
 
is
 
to
 
move
 
quickly
 
and
 
responsibly
 
to
 
bring
 
our
 
stakeholders'
 
space-based
 
broadband
 
connectivity
 
directly
 
to
 
their
 
unmodiﬁed
 
smartphones.
 
From
 
a
 
ﬁnancial
 
perspective,
 
this
 
objective
 
requires
 
careful
 
consideration
 
of
 
our
 
spending,
 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
operating
 
expenses
 
as
 
we
 
scale
 
up
 
our
 
organization
 
and
 
capital
 
expenditures
 
as
 
we
 
incur
 
the
 
necessary
 
costs
 
to
 
secure
 
not
 
only
 
the
 
materials
 
to
 
manufacture
 
our
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites,
 
but
 
also
 
contracts
 
for
 
suﬃcient
 
launch
 
capacity
 
across
 
multiple
 
providers
 
to
 
successfully
 
deploy
 
our
 
constellation.
 
Inherent
 
to
 
our
 
focus
 
on
 
prudent
 
spending
 
is
 
a
 
strategic
 
and
 
thoughtful
 
approach
 
to
 
raising
 
adequate
 
capital
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
execute
 
on
 
our
 
ambitious
 
plans
 
in
 
the
 
growing
 
direct-to-device
 
broadband
 
market
 
that
 
AST
 
created
 
and
 
invented.
 
Moving
 
now
 
to
 
the
 
operating
 
and
 
capital
 
metrics
 
slide,
 
let's
 
review
 
the
 
key
 
operating
 
metrics
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025.
 
On
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
chart,
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter,
 
we
 
incurred
 
non-GAAP
 
adjusted
 
cash
 
operating
 
expenses
 
of
 
$44.9
 
million
 
versus
 
$40.8
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
non-GAAP
 
adjusted
 
operating
 
expenses
 
excludes
 
certain
 
non-cash
 
operating
 
costs,
 
including
 
depreciation
 
and
 
amortization
 
and
 
stock-based
 
compensation.
 
This
 
quarter-over-quarter
 
increase
 
of
 
$4.1
 
million
 
resulted
 
from
 
$1.8
 
million
 
in
 
increased
 
R&D
 
costs,
 
a
 
$1.7
 
million
 
increase
 
in
 
adjusted
 
general
 
and
 
administrative
 
costs
 
and
 
a
 
slight
 
increase
 
of
 
$600,000
 
in
 
adjusted
 
engineering
 
service
 
costs.
 
This
 
modest
 
increase
 
in
 
adjusted
 
OpEx
 
for
 
Q1
 
was
 
expected
 
and
 
in
 
line
 
with
 
the
 
guidance
 
I
 
provided
 
on
 
our
 
last
 
earnings
 
call
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
scale
 
manufacturing,
 
and
 
importantly,
 
add
 
critical
 
talent
 
to
 
our
 
growing
 
organization.
 
Turning
 
towards
 
the
 
second
 
chart
 
on
 
this
 
slide.
 
Our
 
capital
 
expenditures
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025
 
were
 
approximately
 
$124
 
million
 
versus
 
$86
 
million
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024.
 
This
 
ﬁgure
 
was
 
made
 
up
 
of
 
approximately
 
$105
 
million
 
of
 
capitalized
 
direct
 
materials,
 
labor
 
for
 
our
 
Block
 
2
 
Bluebird
 
satellites
 
and
 
payments
 
made
 
in
 
connection
 
with
 
certain
 
launch
 
contracts
 
with
 
the
 
balance
 
relating
 
to
 
facility
 
and
 
production
 
equipment
 
expenditures.
 
This
 
amount
 
was
 
slightly
 
less
 
than
 
the
 
guidance
 
of
 
approximately
 
$150
 
million
 
to
 
$175
 
million
 
that
 
I
 
provided
 
during
 
our
 
last
 
earnings
 
call
 
and
 
was
 
primarily
 
driven
 
by
 
changes
 
in
 
timing
 
of
 
certain
 
launch
 
contract
 
payments
 
from
 
Q1
 
to
 
later
 
quarters
 
during
 
2025.
 
In
 
line
 
with
 
our
 
adjusted
 
operating
 
expenses
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025,
 
we
 
estimate
 
that
 
our
 
adjusted
 
cash
 
operating
 
expenses
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
this
 
year
 
will
 
come
 
in
 
at
 
a
 
similar
 
level
 
of
 
approximately
 
$45
 
million.
 
We
 
expect
 
our
 
capital
 
expenditures
 
to
 
increase
 
signiﬁcantly
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter,
 
driven
 
by
 
our
 
ramp
 
in
 
manufacturing,
 
enabling
 
us
 
to
 
reach
 
our
 
bold
 
plan
 
of
 
producing
 
6
 
satellites
 
per
 
month
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
this
 
year
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
planned
 
payments
 
related
 
to
 
our
 
multiple
 
launch
 
contracts
 
for
 
our
 
2025
 
and
 
2026
 
launch
 
schedule.
 
In
 
line
 
with
 
our
 
increasing
 
CapEx
 
needs,
 
we
 
currently
 
estimate
 
that
 
the
 
average
 
capital
 
costs,
 
including
 
direct
 
materials
 
and
 
launch
 
costs
 
for
 
our
 
constellation
 
of
 
over
 
90
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
will
 
fall
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
$21
 
million
 
to
 
$23
 
million
 
per
 
satellite.
 
This
 
increase
 
over
 
our
 
previous
 
estimate
 
of
 
$19
 
million
 
to
 
$21
 
million
 
per
 
satellite
 
is
 
primarily
 
driven
 
by
 
higher
 
launch
 
costs
 
from
 
our
 
announced
 
near-term
 
launch
 
schedule
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
higher
 
direct
 
materials
 
costs
 
due
 
to
 
recently
 
announced
 
tariﬀs.
 
Our
 
revised
 
cost
 
per
 
satellite
 
estimates
 
are
 
subject
 
to
 
ﬂuctuations
 
based
 
on
 
dynamic
 
geopolitical
 
factors,
 
which
 
impact
 
our
 
direct
 
materials
 
costs.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
the
 
intrinsic
 
value
 
of
 
our
 
future
 
business
 
opportunities
 
far
 
outweighs
 
the
 
modest
 
increase
 
in
 
costs
 
due
 
to
 
tariﬀs.
 
We
 
are
 
empowered
 
by
 
the
 
rising
 
demand
 
for
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
connectivity,
 
an
 
industry
 
that
 
we
 
created
 
and
 
invented
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
validated
 
by
 
the
 
growing
 
commercial
 
and
 
government
 
opportunities
 
before
 
us
 
and
 
want
 
to
 
execute
 
on
 
them
 
as
 
quickly
 
as
 
possible.
 
Despite
 
this
 
increase
 
in
 
cost
 
per
 
satellite,
 
we
 
reiterate
 
our
 
belief
 
that
 
the
 
operation
 
of
 
a
 
constellation
 
of
 
25
 
Bluebird
 
satellites
 
will
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
potentially
 
generate
 
cash
 
ﬂows
 
from
 
operating
 
activities.
 
We
 
do
 
expect
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
CapEx
 
in
 
Q2
 
to
 
a
 
range
 
we
 
believe
 
will
 
be
 
between
 
$230
 
million
 
to
 
$270
 
million
 
to
 
primarily
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
timing
 
of
 
payments
 
on
 
multiple
 
launch
 
contracts.
 
The
 
timing
 
of
 
the
 
changes
 
in
 
our
 
adjusted
 
operating
 
expenditures
 
and
 
capital
 
expenditures,
 
as
 
I
 
have
 
just
 
described,
 
could
 
be
 
delayed
 
or
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
realized
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
factors.
 
While
 
Q1
 
and
 
prior
 
recent
 
quarters
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
company's
 
stage
 
as
 
pre-monetization
 
with
 
only
 
modest
 
revenue
 
recognized
 
in
 
connection
 
with
 
primarily
 
a
 
limited
 
government
 
application
 
contract,
 
I
 
am
 
pleased
 
to
 
begin
 
speaking
 
to
 
you
 
about
 
our
 
expectations
 
for
 
revenue
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
periods.
 
Our
 
revenue
 
opportunity
 
is
 
intimately
 
linked
 
to
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
our
 
deployed
 
satellites.
 
As
 
we
 
previously
 
stated,
 
we
 
believe
 
we
 
can
 
enable
 
continuous
 
SpaceMobile
 
service
 
across
 
key
 
markets
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
Europe,
 
Japan
 
and
 
other
 
strategic
 
markets
 
with
 
the
 
launch
 
and
 
operation
 
of
 
approximately
 
45
 
to
 
60
 
Bluebird
 
satellites.
 
We
 
also
 
plan
 
to
 
achieve
 
non-continuous
 
SpaceMobile
 
service
 
in
 
selected
 
targeted
 
geographical
 
markets
 
with
 
the
 
launch
 
of
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
25
 
Bluebird
 
satellites.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
support
 
U.S.
 
government
 
applications
 
currently
 
ongoing
 
and
 
accelerating
 
as
 
we
 
launch
 
additional
 
satellites.
 
As
 
we
 
execute
 
our
 
launch
 
and
 
operation
 
commencement
 
eﬀorts,
 
we
 
expect
 
revenue
 
to
 
ramp
 
towards
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year
 
and
 
into
 
2026.
 
Speciﬁcally,
 
we
 
believe
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
revenue
 
opportunity
 
in
 
2025
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
$50
 
million
 
to
 
$75
 
million
 
back-end
 
loaded
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year
 
and
 
based
 
on
 
several
 
contingencies,
 
including:
 
one,
 
the
 
successful
 
launch
 
and
 
deployment
 
of
 
Block
 
2
 
Bluebird
 
satellites
 
related
 
to
 
U.S.
 
government
 
applications'
 
contractual
 
milestone
 
achievements;
 
two,
 
critical
 
gateway
 
equipment
 
sales
 
to
 
our
 
MNO
 
partners
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
their
 
anticipated
 
commercialization
 
eﬀorts
 
of
 
SpaceMobile
 
service;
 
and
 
three,
 
service
 
revenues
 
in
 
connection
 
with
 
the
 
activation
 
of
 
our
 
commercial
 
service
 
provided
 
by
 
our
 
existing
 
and
 
planned
 
deployed
 
and
 
operational
 
satellites,
 
currently
 
6
 
in
 
low
 
earth
 
orbit
 
with
 
more
 
to
 
come
 
over
 
the
 
6
 
to
 
9
 
months.
 
There
 
can
 
be
 
no
 
assurances
 
that
 
we
 
will
 
achieve
 
any
 
or
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
objectives,
 
and
 
our
 
actual
 
revenue
 
results
 
will
 
vary
 
based
 
on
 
a
 
multitude
 
of
 
factors.
 
Nevertheless,
 
the
 
AST
 
team
 
is
 
proud
 
to
 
be
 
commencing
 
our
 
revenue
 
ramp,
 
and
 
I
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
updating
 
you
 
in
 
subsequent
 
quarters
 
on
 
our
 
progress.
 
Finally,
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
chart
 
on
 
the
 
slide,
 
we
 
ended
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
with
 
$874.5
 
million
 
in
 
cash,
 
up
 
from
 
$567.5
 
million
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024.
 
This
 
signiﬁcant
 
increase
 
in
 
cash
 
was
 
driven
 
primarily
 
by
 
approximately
 
$403
 
million
 
received
 
from
 
the
 
convertible
 
notes
 
oﬀering
 
in
 
late
 
January
 
that
 
I
 
discussed
 
last
 
call
 
and
 
approximately
 
$55
 
million
 
raised
 
from
 
the
 
remaining
 
amount
 
available
 
under
 
the
 
September
 
2024
 
at-the-market
 
or
 
ATM
 
facility.
 
Our
 
eﬀective
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
ATM
 
facility
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
9
 
months
 
allowed
 
us
 
to
 
increase
 
critical
 
liquidity
 
and
 
supplement
 
other
 
strategic
 
ﬁnancing
 
initiatives.
 
Now
 
that,
 
that
 
facility
 
is
 
fully
 
utilized,
 
today,
 
we
 
are
 
establishing
 
an
 
incremental
 
2025
 
at-the-market
 
or
 
ATM
 
facility
 
for
 
up
 
to
 
$500
 
million
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
3
 
years,
 
available
 
to
 
the
 
company
 
to
 
accelerate
 
our
 
bold
 
operational
 
plans
 
to
 
bring
 
our
 
SpaceMobile
 
service
 
to
 
market
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible.
 
We
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
utilize
 
this
 
funding
 
source
 
in
 
a
 
disciplined
 
fashion,
 
balancing
 
our
 
capital
 
needs
 
to
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
interest
 
of
 
our
 
shareholders.
 
We
 
are
 
also
 
evaluating
 
a
 
path
 
to
 
provide
 
for
 
an
 
equipment
 
loan
 
facility
 
of
 
between
 
$50
 
million
 
to
 
$100
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
non-dilutive
 
funding
 
to
 
support
 
our
 
manufacturing
 
expansion.
 
We
 
will
 
provide
 
additional
 
information
 
on
 
that
 
facility
 
as
 
we
 
progress
 
our
 
conversations.
 
And
 
ﬁnally,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
make
 
good
 
progress
 
on
 
nondilutive
 
ﬁnancing
 
from
 
quasi-governmental
 
sources
 
of
 
capital
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
We
 
recently
 
completed
 
initial
 
clearances
 
for
 
funding,
 
which
 
commences
 
an
 
approximately
 
6
 
to
 
9-month
 
diligence
 
and
 
documentation
 
phase
 
for
 
over
 
$0.5
 
billion
 
in
 
potential
 
nondilutive
 
capital
 
from
 
multiple
 
U.S.
 
and
 
international
 
agencies.
 
We
 
will
 
provide
 
updates
 
as
 
appropriate,
 
and
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
partner
 
banks
 
and
 
our
 
advisers
 
to
 
reﬁne
 
our
 
alternatives.
 
Revenue
 
is
 
ramping
 
on
 
plan
 
and
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
remains
 
well
 
positioned
 
to
 
fund
 
our
 
near-term
 
operational
 
plans.
 
We
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
leverage
 
our
 
balance
 
sheet
 
and
 
ATM
 
facility
 
with
 
prudence
 
while
 
focusing
 
on
 
the
 
myriad
 
opportunities
 
available
 
to
 
us
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
nondilutive
 
prepayments.
 
As
 
a
 
stakeholder
 
in
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile,
 
your
 
takeaway
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025
 
is
 
simple.
 
The
 
company
 
is
 
on
 
target
 
and
 
continuing
 
to
 
execute
 
against
 
its
 
accelerated
 
operational
 
plans
 
for
 
2025
 
and
 
2026.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
to
 
accomplish
 
this
 
calendar
 
year,
 
and
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
was
 
a
 
solid
 
start
 
to
 
what
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
most
 
exciting
 
year
 
in
 
AST's
 
short
 
but
 
impressive
 
history.
 
Thank
 
you
 
all
 
for
 
your
 
continued
 
support.
 
And
 
with
 
that,
 
this
 
completes
 
the
 
presentation
 
component
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
update
 
call,
 
and
 
I'll
 
pass
 
it
 
back
 
to
 
Scott.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Andy.
 
Before
 
we
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
queue
 
of
 
analyst
 
questions,
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
address
 
a
 
few
 
of
 
the
 
questions
 
submitted
 
by
 
our
 
investors.
 
Operator,
 
could
 
you
 
please
 
start
 
us
 
oﬀ
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
question?
 
Operator
 
Scott
 
from
 
Indiana
 
asks,
 
"Any
 
further
 
details
 
to
 
share
 
on
 
the
 
Ligado
 
transaction?"
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
Yes.
 
This
 
is
 
Andy.
 
I'll
 
be
 
happy
 
to
 
take
 
that
 
question
 
and
 
appreciate
 
the
 
question,
 
Scott.
 
Yes,
 
there
 
are
 
some
 
updates
 
that
 
we'd
 
be
 
happy
 
to
 
share.
 
I
 
mean,
 
as
 
a
 
reminder,
 
the
 
transaction
 
that
 
Scott
 
asked
 
about
 
is
 
for
 
AST
 
to
 
acquire
 
usage
 
rights
 
for
 
45
 
megahertz
 
of
 
mid-band
 
spectrum
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
So
 
we
 
view
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
huge
 
fuel
 
to
 
our
 
business
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
as
 
we
 
look
 
to
 
actually
 
access
 
spectrum
 
ourselves
 
that
 
can
 
augment
 
our
 
service.
 
We
 
announced
 
the
 
deﬁnitive
 
agreements
 
signed
 
toward
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
quarter
 
in
 
late
 
March,
 
and
 
we're
 
happy
 
to
 
say
 
that
 
we
 
believe
 
the
 
approval
 
process
 
is
 
on
 
schedule
 
and
 
that
 
we'll
 
have
 
more
 
to
 
say
 
about
 
this
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
weeks.
 
Importantly,
 
we
 
are
 
looking
 
at
 
a
 
structure
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
are
 
ﬁnancing
 
our
 
usage
 
rights
 
with
 
collateral
 
that
 
is
 
restricted
 
to
 
the
 
actual
 
spectrum
 
we're
 
acquiring.
 
So
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
modest
 
impact
 
in
 
G&A
 
in
 
subsequent
 
quarters,
 
but
 
we
 
are
 
putting
 
in
 
place
 
a
 
separate
 
ﬁnancing
 
package
 
related
 
to
 
this
 
strategic
 
L-band
 
acquisition.
 
So
 
thanks
 
for
 
the
 
question.
 
Operator
 
Rick
 
from
 
The
 
Netherlands
 
asks,
 
"Looks
 
like
 
the
 
defense
 
use
 
case
 
is
 
growing.
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
outlook
 
there?"
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
We've
 
been
 
talking
 
about
 
the
 
government
 
use
 
case
 
with
 
increasing
 
emphasis
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
4
 
quarters
 
or
 
so.
 
And
 
in
 
general,
 
as
 
everybody
 
can
 
see,
 
government
 
demand
 
for
 
space-based
 
solutions
 
like
 
ours
 
and
 
others
 
has
 
been
 
surging.
 
This
 
is
 
driven
 
by
 
an
 
increased
 
focus
 
on
 
defending
 
our
 
nation
 
in
 
space
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
something
 
that
 
we're
 
well
 
positioned
 
around
 
because
 
of
 
our
 
extremely
 
innovative
 
new
 
tech
 
and
 
the
 
largest
 
phased
 
arrays
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
put
 
into
 
orbit
 
today
 
commercially.
 
So,
 
we've
 
already
 
started
 
deriving
 
revenue
 
from
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
government
 
contract
 
awards.
 
There's
 
now
 
6
 
of
 
them
 
to
 
date
 
that
 
served
 
as
 
initial
 
validations
 
for
 
this
 
technology.
 
These
 
contract
 
awards
 
provide
 
clear
 
paths
 
for
 
applications
 
in
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
use
 
cases.
 
In
 
late
 
2024,
 
we
 
were
 
selected
 
by
 
the
 
Space
 
Development
 
Agency
 
for
 
a
 
$43
 
million
 
contract
 
and
 
that's
 
a
 
non-communications
 
use
 
case.
 
But
 
importantly,
 
today,
 
we're
 
announcing
 
a
 
DIU
 
contract.
 
And
 
that
 
is
 
--
 
you
 
can
 
read
 
that
 
as
 
communications
 
use
 
cases
 
across
 
many
 
government
 
agencies,
 
across
 
many
 
use
 
cases.
 
So,
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
seen
 
really
 
great
 
progress
 
on
 
several
 
diﬀerent
 
use
 
cases
 
that
 
our
 
unique
 
technology
 
can
 
oﬀer,
 
and
 
we're
 
really
 
excited
 
about
 
continuing
 
to
 
grow
 
that
 
even
 
as
 
early
 
as
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
as
 
Andy
 
talked
 
about.
 
Operator
 
Matt
 
from
 
Massachusetts
 
asks,
 
"Do
 
you
 
plan
 
to
 
submit
 
any
 
proposals
 
for
 
the
 
announced
 
$25
 
billion
 
Golden
 
Dome
 
project?"
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Matt,
 
for
 
the
 
question.
 
We
 
really
 
think
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
very
 
well
 
positioned
 
with
 
our
 
technology
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
important
 
contributor
 
to
 
the
 
actual
 
goals
 
outlined
 
in
 
the
 
Golden
 
Dome.
 
We
 
think
 
the
 
size
 
and
 
power
 
of
 
our
 
satellites
 
are
 
unique
 
and
 
completely
 
diﬀerentiated
 
of
 
what
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
industry
 
or
 
by
 
our
 
adversaries.
 
And
 
we
 
think
 
that
 
our
 
technology
 
will
 
enable
 
applications
 
for
 
national
 
security
 
that
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
important
 
for
 
this
 
particular
 
program.
 
Scott,
 
you
 
may
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
and
 
where
 
it's
 
approved?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Yes.
 
For
 
those
 
not
 
as
 
familiar
 
with
 
this,
 
the
 
$25
 
billion
 
is
 
a
 
reference
 
to
 
what
 
left
 
the
 
House
 
Armed
 
Services
 
Committee
 
recently,
 
and
 
will
 
go
 
for
 
a
 
vote
 
with
 
the
 
whole
 
house
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
budget
 
reconciliation
 
process.
 
Importantly,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
budget
 
for
 
ﬁscal
 
year
 
2026.
 
This
 
is
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
budget
 
reconciliation
 
package
 
that
 
is
 
only
 
subject
 
to
 
a
 
50
 
vote
 
in
 
the
 
Senate.
 
So,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
the
 
House
 
Armed
 
Services
 
Committee
 
is
 
looking
 
to
 
prefund
 
Golden
 
Dome
 
and
 
support
 
this
 
really
 
signiﬁcant
 
national
 
security
 
goal.
 
Operator
 
Scott
 
from
 
Indiana
 
asks,
 
"Are
 
shareholders
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
invited
 
to
 
future
 
launches
 
this
 
fall?"
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Yes,
 
absolutely.
 
We
 
loved
 
hosting
 
our
 
shareholders
 
at
 
the
 
September
 
launch
 
event
 
at
 
the
 
Cape.
 
And
 
we
 
were
 
really
 
excited
 
to
 
host
 
over
 
1,000
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
of
 
the
 
night
 
in
 
the
 
rain.
 
Many
 
of
 
you
 
enjoyed
 
that,
 
and
 
we
 
certainly
 
did.
 
For
 
the
 
upcoming
 
launch
 
in
 
July,
 
for
 
reasons
 
beyond
 
our
 
control,
 
we
 
won't
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
invite
 
folks
 
to
 
our
 
launch
 
in
 
India.
 
But
 
as
 
Abel
 
laid
 
out,
 
our
 
launch
 
schedule,
 
with
 
an
 
orbital
 
launch
 
every
 
1
 
to
 
2
 
months
 
on
 
average,
 
going
 
forward,
 
we
 
expect
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
exciting
 
events
 
to
 
come
 
at
 
the
 
Cape
 
and
 
we'll
 
be
 
sure
 
to
 
keep
 
everybody
 
updated
 
as
 
these
 
come
 
together
 
and
 
hope
 
to
 
see
 
many
 
of
 
you
 
there.
 
Operator
 
Murillo
 
from
 
Portugal
 
asks,
 
"On
 
Monday,
 
April
 
28,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
power
 
outage
 
that
 
led
 
to
 
most
 
of
 
Spain
 
and
 
Portugal
 
being
 
at
 
a
 
standstill,
 
grounding
 
planes,
 
halting
 
public
 
transport
 
and
 
forcing
 
hospitals
 
to
 
suspend
 
routine
 
operations
 
and
 
mainly
 
cutting
 
all
 
types
 
of
 
communications,
 
landlines,
 
mobile
 
phones
 
or
 
Internet
 
access.
 
In
 
my
 
case,
 
it
 
was
 
10
 
hours
 
without
 
access
 
to
 
any
 
type
 
of
 
communications
 
except
 
radio.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
aware
 
of
 
it,
 
but
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
happy
 
to
 
know
 
ASC's
 
short-term
 
plans
 
for
 
Europe?"
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Murillo.
 
And
 
we
 
saw
 
this
 
event
 
on
 
the
 
news,
 
of
 
course,
 
and
 
watched
 
it
 
with
 
interest.
 
Emergencies,
 
whether
 
caused
 
by
 
infrastructure
 
failures
 
or
 
natural
 
disasters,
 
these
 
cause
 
immediate
 
and
 
lingering
 
need,
 
which
 
is
 
only
 
compounded
 
when
 
communication
 
is
 
inaccessible
 
So,
 
our
 
service
 
stands
 
to
 
provide
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
connectivity
 
directly
 
to
 
the
 
phone
 
in
 
your
 
pocket.
 
And
 
this
 
means
 
consumers
 
can
 
feel
 
safer
 
in
 
emergency
 
situations,
 
knowing
 
they'll
 
still
 
have
 
this
 
connectivity
 
despite
 
what's
 
happening
 
on
 
the
 
ground.
 
And
 
as
 
this
 
applies
 
to
 
Europe
 
speciﬁcally,
 
our
 
joint
 
venture
 
with
 
Vodafone
 
will
 
exclusively
 
distribute
 
our
 
service
 
across
 
Europe.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
we'll
 
be
 
sharing
 
ground-based
 
infrastructure
 
to
 
manage
 
geographic
 
boundaries
 
and
 
drive
 
turnkey
 
solutions
 
to
 
increase
 
take-up,
 
both
 
for
 
connectivity
 
for
 
citizens
 
across
 
the
 
continent
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
in
 
very
 
important
 
emergency
 
periods
 
of
 
need
 
like
 
the
 
one
 
you
 
described.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
outside
 
of
 
Europe,
 
we
 
recently
 
received
 
special
 
temporary
 
authority
 
from
 
the
 
FCC
 
to
 
do
 
FirstNet
 
testing
 
activation
 
on
 
public
 
safety
 
spectrum.
 
That's
 
really
 
important
 
to
 
us
 
as
 
a
 
priority
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
And
 
in
 
Japan,
 
of
 
course,
 
our
 
long-time
 
partner,
 
Rakuten
 
Mobile,
 
successfully
 
did
 
a
 
video
 
call
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
a
 
live
 
audience.
 
So
 
these
 
are
 
places
 
where
 
this
 
capability,
 
both
 
emergency
 
backup,
 
disaster
 
recovery
 
and
 
consumer
 
emergency
 
support
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
really
 
support
 
quite
 
nicely.
 
And
 
with
 
that,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
thank
 
our
 
shareholders
 
for
 
submitting
 
those
 
questions.
 
Operator,
 
let's
 
open
 
the
 
call
 
to
 
analyst
 
questions
 
now.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
Our
 
ﬁrst
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
with
 
Cantor
 
Fitzgerald.
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
Maybe
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
discuss
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
higher
 
launch
 
costs
 
and
 
talk
 
me
 
through
 
or
 
talk
 
us
 
through
 
how
 
is
 
that
 
related
 
to
 
--
 
is
 
that
 
related
 
to
 
like
 
more
 
faring
 
conﬁguration
 
per
 
satellite?
 
Or
 
are
 
there
 
other
 
pricing
 
factors
 
to
 
consider?
 
And
 
then
 
lastly,
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
maybe
 
talk
 
about
 
how
 
AST
 
thinks
 
about
 
passing
 
through
 
those
 
costs
 
to
 
other
 
launch
 
suppliers
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
liquidated
 
damages?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Colin,
 
I'll
 
kick
 
oﬀ
 
and
 
Andy
 
can
 
add
 
anything
 
additional.
 
Basically,
 
the
 
demand
 
signals
 
we're
 
receiving
 
are
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
service
 
to
 
market
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible.
 
So,
 
the
 
way
 
we've
 
organized
 
the
 
whole
 
program
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
year,
 
1.5
 
years
 
is
 
against
 
that
 
goal.
 
So
 
what
 
you're
 
seeing
 
is
 
essentially
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
pull
 
forward
 
on
 
launch
 
in
 
a
 
time
 
when
 
launch
 
was
 
harder
 
to
 
get.
 
And
 
so,
 
we've
 
spent
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
than
 
anticipated
 
just
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
timeline
 
moving
 
fast,
 
as
 
Andy
 
said.
 
And
 
on
 
the
 
tariﬀ
 
side,
 
there's
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
in
 
there.
 
We
 
--
 
more
 
than
 
half
 
of
 
our
 
CapEx
 
is
 
launched
 
at
 
this
 
point,
 
but
 
the
 
portion
 
that's
 
materials,
 
there's
 
some,
 
particularly
 
raw
 
materials,
 
that
 
we
 
source
 
from
 
abroad.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
totality
 
of
 
the
 
move
 
there
 
in
 
unit
 
price,
 
it's
 
--
 
those
 
2
 
elements
 
are
 
what's
 
driving
 
it.
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
Scott,
 
this
 
is
 
Andy.
 
I
 
completely
 
agree.
 
I
 
would
 
just
 
add,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
mentioned
 
this,
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
dynamic
 
situation.
 
I
 
mean,
 
we're
 
looking
 
at
 
a
 
tariﬀ
 
impact
 
that
 
many
 
companies
 
are
 
looking
 
at
 
right
 
now,
 
but
 
we
 
all
 
know
 
that's
 
somewhat
 
volatile
 
and
 
it
 
ebbs
 
and
 
ﬂows
 
with
 
geopolitical
 
news.
 
So,
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
work
 
to
 
optimize.
 
We
 
continue
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
our
 
own
 
ability
 
to
 
optimize
 
things
 
like
 
payload
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
future
 
launch
 
optionality.
 
But
 
as
 
Scott
 
said,
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
getting
 
our
 
satellites
 
built
 
and
 
launched
 
quickly.
 
And
 
in
 
exchange
 
for
 
doing
 
that
 
in
 
an
 
environment
 
in
 
which
 
tariﬀs
 
are
 
a
 
reality,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
slight
 
increase
 
from,
 
call
 
it
 
the
 
20
 
midpoint
 
to
 
the
 
22
 
midpoint.
 
And
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
press
 
on
 
that.
 
But
 
the
 
good
 
news
 
is,
 
as
 
we
 
started
 
the
 
notes,
 
we're
 
about
 
to
 
kick
 
oﬀ
 
a
 
launch
 
cadence
 
that
 
starts
 
in
 
July
 
with
 
1
 
to
 
2
 
--
 
every
 
1
 
to
 
2
 
months
 
as
 
we
 
head
 
out
 
of
 
'25
 
into
 
'26.
 
So,
 
that's
 
our
 
priority
 
right
 
now.
 
And
 
as
 
I
 
noted,
 
we
 
reiterate
 
our
 
belief
 
that
 
even
 
an
 
increase
 
like
 
that
 
is
 
mitigated
 
considerably
 
by
 
the
 
opportunity
 
of
 
bringing
 
our
 
service
 
to
 
market
 
as
 
quickly
 
as
 
possible.
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
Okay.
 
Alright,
 
appreciate
 
the
 
color.
 
And
 
then
 
maybe
 
talking
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
spectrum
 
portfolios
 
and
 
spectrum
 
sharing,
 
like
 
2
 
subject
 
dynamics
 
to
 
consider.
 
One
 
is
 
maybe
 
talk
 
about
 
how
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
EchoStar's
 
spectrum
 
portfolio
 
and
 
maybe
 
where
 
you
 
could
 
unlock
 
the
 
most
 
amount
 
of
 
value
 
across
 
RF
 
bands.
 
And
 
then
 
also
 
maybe
 
some
 
commentary
 
on
 
the
 
FCC
 
spectrum
 
sharing
 
commentary
 
and
 
maybe
 
just
 
communicating
 
kind
 
of
 
how
 
customers
 
are
 
talking
 
about
 
any
 
potential
 
interference
 
in
 
pricing
 
recovery
 
or
 
damages
 
recovery
 
from
 
other
 
players?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Colin,
 
that's
 
a
 
great
 
question.
 
Well,
 
for
 
those
 
that
 
are
 
not
 
familiar
 
with
 
this
 
business,
 
spectrum
 
is
 
like
 
fuel
 
for
 
our
 
business.
 
And
 
we
 
are
 
on
 
a
 
strategy
 
that
 
actually
 
maximize
 
access
 
to
 
existing
 
phones
 
in
 
availability
 
of
 
spectrum
 
on
 
the
 
phones.
 
And
 
also,
 
we
 
have
 
basically
 
split
 
the
 
program
 
in
 
2
 
phases.
 
One
 
that
 
we
 
call
 
low
 
band
 
which
 
we
 
started
 
with
 
AT&T
 
and
 
Verizon,
 
Vodafone,
 
Rakuten
 
and
 
others,
 
where
 
we're
 
basically
 
sharing
 
the
 
spectrum
 
of
 
the
 
operator
 
and
 
reusing
 
that
 
spectrum
 
that
 
is
 
--
 
it
 
was
 
originally
 
allocated
 
exclusively
 
for
 
terrestrial.
 
We're
 
sharing
 
it
 
for
 
space
 
application.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
that's
 
the
 
faster
 
go-to-market,
 
and
 
we
 
believe
 
also
 
that
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
service
 
possible
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
oﬀer
 
to
 
the
 
customers
 
given
 
the
 
premium
 
nature
 
of
 
that
 
spectrum
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
penetration,
 
ability
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
walls,
 
the
 
frame
 
of
 
an
 
airplane,
 
the
 
fuselage
 
of
 
a
 
car
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
been
 
demonstrated
 
with
 
our
 
current
 
operating
 
satellites.
 
But
 
as
 
you're
 
probably
 
aware,
 
we
 
also
 
have
 
signed
 
a
 
deﬁnitive
 
agreement
 
to
 
complement
 
our
 
low-band
 
spectrum
 
coming
 
from
 
our
 
partner
 
operators
 
with
 
our
 
own
 
spectrum
 
in
 
the
 
mid-band
 
in
 
the
 
neighborhood
 
of
 
45
 
megahertz,
 
which
 
together
 
with
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
our
 
satellites
 
will
 
enable
 
120
 
megabits
 
per
 
second
 
per
 
individual
 
cell
 
and
 
supporting
 
thousands
 
of
 
cells
 
per
 
satellite.
 
So,
 
our
 
spectrum
 
strategy
 
is
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
the
 
low
 
band
 
and
 
the
 
mid-band,
 
low-band
 
partner
 
with
 
the
 
operators
 
to
 
get
 
access
 
to
 
that
 
premium
 
band
 
that
 
is
 
available
 
in
 
every
 
phone
 
that
 
works
 
today
 
without
 
requiring
 
any
 
modiﬁcation
 
to
 
the
 
phone
 
or
 
any
 
new
 
change
 
to
 
the
 
phone
 
and
 
keep
 
fueling
 
the
 
network
 
with
 
a
 
spectrum,
 
in
 
this
 
case,
 
when
 
we
 
concluded
 
the
 
current
 
transaction
 
to
 
own
 
that
 
45
 
megahertz,
 
fueling
 
that
 
with
 
probably
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
largest
 
block
 
of
 
spectrum
 
certainly
 
that
 
exists
 
below
 
the
 
6
 
gigahertz
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Mike
 
Crawford
 
with
 
B.
 
Riley
 
Securities.
 
Michael
 
Crawford
 
Just
 
continuing
 
on
 
that
 
theme
 
where
 
you
 
have
 
this
 
bifurcated
 
strategy
 
of
 
sharing
 
low-band
 
spectrum
 
with
 
your
 
MNO
 
partners,
 
but
 
now
 
getting
 
the
 
cell
 
band
 
spectrum
 
from
 
Ligado,
 
does
 
that
 
change
 
the
 
way
 
you're
 
thinking
 
about
 
future
 
or
 
current
 
MNO
 
agreements
 
where
 
they
 
might
 
become
 
more
 
bespoke
 
versus
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
very
 
standard
 
template
 
that
 
you
 
initially
 
have
 
been
 
working
 
towards?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Well,
 
not
 
really.
 
I
 
mean,
 
our
 
focus
 
is
 
the
 
user
 
experience
 
for
 
the
 
consumer
 
that
 
buy
 
the
 
service
 
from
 
the
 
MNO.
 
We
 
think
 
entering
 
into
 
the
 
market
 
with
 
the
 
low-band
 
spectrum
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
great
 
access
 
to
 
billions
 
of
 
phones.
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
5
 
billion
 
phones
 
that
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
low-band
 
spectrum.
 
But
 
this
 
is
 
simply
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
enhance
 
and
 
permit
 
more
 
simultaneous
 
users
 
with
 
higher
 
data
 
rates
 
when
 
we
 
combine
 
both
 
spectrums
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
1
 
network,
 
which
 
is
 
our
 
network.
 
So
 
we
 
don't
 
--
 
we
 
see
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
technical
 
capability
 
to
 
basically
 
give
 
the
 
user
 
the
 
best
 
of
 
both
 
spectrum.
 
One
 
is
 
penetration
 
and
 
availability
 
on
 
phones,
 
another
 
one
 
is
 
density
 
with
 
a
 
large
 
block
 
of
 
capacity,
 
in
 
this
 
case,
 
45
 
megahertz.
 
Michael
 
Crawford
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
just
 
one
 
ﬁnal
 
question
 
from
 
me.
 
On
 
the
 
custom
 
ASIC,
 
will
 
we
 
--
 
what
 
batch
 
of
 
satellites
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
4
 
you're
 
launching
 
after
 
this
 
Indian
 
launch,
 
would
 
you
 
expect
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
ones
 
with
 
the
 
custom
 
ASIC
 
included?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
in
 
approximately
 
2
 
launches
 
after
 
the
 
next
 
launch.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
very
 
soon.
 
It's
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
integration
 
to
 
the
 
actual
 
satellite
 
built
 
out,
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
planned
 
not
 
in
 
this
 
next
 
imminent
 
launch,
 
but
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
launches
 
after
 
that.
 
And
 
as
 
we
 
said,
 
yes,
 
we're
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
into
 
a
 
cadence
 
so
 
that
 
we'll
 
be
 
launching
 
very
 
constantly
 
during
 
the
 
next
 
6
 
to
 
9
 
months.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Chris
 
Schoell
 
with
 
UBS.
 
Christopher
 
Schoell
 
Great.
 
Last
 
quarter,
 
you
 
indicated
 
you
 
were
 
preparing
 
to
 
run
 
beta
 
tests
 
with
 
your
 
carrier
 
partners.
 
Can
 
you
 
update
 
us
 
on
 
the
 
status
 
of
 
those
 
tests
 
and
 
any
 
early
 
learnings
 
you're
 
willing
 
to
 
share
 
at
 
this
 
stage?
 
And
 
you
 
talked
 
about
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
manufacture
 
6
 
satellites
 
per
 
month
 
by
 
4Q,
 
which
 
is
 
later
 
than
 
the
 
timeline
 
you
 
mentioned
 
last
 
quarter.
 
Can
 
you
 
just
 
walk
 
us
 
through
 
the
 
cause
 
and
 
what
 
still
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
to
 
achieve
 
that
 
milestone?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
We
 
had
 
already
 
started
 
activations
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
Europe
 
and
 
Japan.
 
I
 
mean,
 
as
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
fact,
 
Rakuten,
 
Vodafone,
 
AT&T
 
and
 
Verizon,
 
they
 
all
 
announced
 
the
 
initial
 
usage
 
of
 
video
 
capabilities,
 
which
 
is
 
basically
 
the
 
most
 
diﬃcult
 
application
 
to
 
run
 
when
 
you're
 
running
 
a
 
broadband
 
capability.
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
we
 
support
 
streaming,
 
we
 
support
 
voice,
 
we
 
support
 
text,
 
we
 
support
 
e-mail,
 
we
 
support
 
FaceTime.
 
We
 
support
 
any
 
application
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
run
 
in
 
your
 
--
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
run
 
a
 
video
 
call,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
live
 
streaming
 
capability,
 
you
 
can
 
support
 
basically
 
any
 
native
 
application
 
that
 
is
 
in
 
your
 
phone.
 
So,
 
we
 
are
 
at
 
that
 
phase.
 
We
 
will
 
be
 
also
 
starting
 
lining
 
up
 
all
 
the
 
5600
 
cells
 
in
 
United
 
States.
 
We're
 
starting
 
that
 
process
 
starting
 
in
 
June,
 
July
 
till
 
we
 
complete
 
that
 
into
 
the
 
beta
 
service.
 
And
 
we
 
will
 
start
 
oﬀering
 
a
 
service
 
that
 
it
 
will
 
reset
 
--
 
on
 
our
 
beta
 
plan,
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
an
 
oﬀer
 
that
 
resemble
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
service
 
when
 
we
 
have
 
full
 
constellation,
 
but
 
intermittent
 
as
 
we
 
build
 
out
 
more
 
satellites.
 
So
 
we
 
are
 
on
 
target
 
for
 
that
 
this
 
year.
 
We're
 
on
 
target
 
to
 
start
 
the
 
beta
 
services
 
this
 
year
 
to
 
oﬀer
 
broadband
 
that
 
include
 
voice,
 
text,
 
data,
 
e-mail,
 
Internet,
 
FaceTime
 
and
 
video
 
calls.
 
So,
 
that
 
is
 
still
 
on
 
target.
 
The
 
launch
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
generation,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
largest
 
generation,
 
is
 
3.5x
 
bigger
 
than
 
the
 
Block
 
1
 
is
 
scheduled
 
for
 
July.
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
maintained
 
our
 
plan
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
capacity
 
of
 
6
 
per
 
month,
 
a
 
raise
 
which
 
start
 
in
 
June,
 
July
 
again,
 
also
 
this
 
year.
 
When
 
we're
 
referring
 
to
 
the
 
6
 
satellites
 
per
 
month
 
is
 
the
 
fully
 
integrated
 
satellite,
 
they're
 
more
 
closer
 
towards
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
Christopher
 
Schoell
 
And
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
ﬁt
 
in
 
one
 
more.
 
Appreciate
 
there's
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
moving
 
pieces,
 
but
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
to
 
2026
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
fund
 
the
 
launch
 
of
 
the
 
60
 
satellites,
 
any
 
help
 
sizing
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
capital
 
you
 
would
 
need
 
to
 
raise
 
and
 
how
 
you
 
evaluate
 
the
 
diﬀerent
 
sources,
 
whether
 
it'd
 
be
 
the
 
ATM
 
or
 
the
 
quasi-government
 
progress
 
you
 
mentioned?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes,
 
I
 
will
 
let
 
Scott
 
and
 
Andy
 
to
 
answer
 
that
 
in
 
more
 
detail,
 
but
 
we
 
are
 
focusing
 
in
 
non-diluted
 
capital.
 
I
 
mean,
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
time,
 
we're
 
giving
 
initial
 
indication
 
of
 
revenue
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
this
 
year
 
between
 
$50
 
million
 
and
 
$75
 
million.
 
We
 
have
 
advanced
 
signiﬁcantly
 
our
 
non-dilutive
 
ﬁnancing
 
from
 
sources
 
like
 
IFC
 
and
 
the
 
EXIM
 
Bank.
 
And
 
more
 
importantly,
 
contracts,
 
either
 
government
 
contracts,
 
MNO
 
contracts,
 
infrastructure
 
payments
 
from
 
operators.
 
And
 
that's
 
our
 
focus,
 
is
 
basically
 
getting
 
ﬁnanced
 
by
 
non-dilutive
 
sources.
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
Right.
 
Abel,
 
this
 
is
 
Andy
 
here.
 
Chris,
 
as
 
well.
 
Just
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
piggyback
 
on
 
that.
 
I
 
mean
 
the
 
ATM
 
gives
 
us
 
great
 
ﬂexibility,
 
and
 
we've
 
proven
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
disciplined
 
in
 
how
 
we
 
use
 
it.
 
And
 
it's
 
an
 
instrument
 
that
 
we
 
like
 
to
 
have
 
as
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
all
 
optionality.
 
It's
 
not
 
the
 
priority
 
for
 
sure.
 
Last
 
quarter,
 
we
 
did
 
mention
 
that
 
our
 
convertible
 
raise
 
put
 
us
 
in
 
a
 
position
 
to
 
fund
 
through
 
the
 
25
 
satellites,
 
which
 
is
 
our
 
threshold
 
for
 
non-continuous
 
service
 
in
 
major
 
markets
 
and
 
beyond.
 
And
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
a
 
constellation
 
for
 
over
 
60
 
for
 
the
 
U.S.
 
and
 
similar
 
geographies
 
and
 
over
 
90,
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
the
 
math
 
and
 
sort
 
of
 
look
 
at
 
what
 
the
 
average
 
cost
 
with
 
materials
 
and
 
launch
 
costs
 
are
 
that
 
we
 
give
 
and
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
sense
 
for
 
what
 
we
 
need.
 
The
 
reality
 
is,
 
we
 
feel
 
very
 
fortunate
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
opportunities,
 
both
 
on
 
the
 
equity
 
side
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
debt
 
programs
 
like
 
the
 
EXIM
 
Bank
 
ﬁnancing,
 
diﬀerent
 
manufacturing
 
equipment,
 
which
 
we're
 
quite
 
mature
 
in
 
our
 
exploration
 
to
 
do.
 
So,
 
you
 
put
 
all
 
that
 
together
 
and
 
also
 
layer
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
it
 
the
 
priority
 
to
 
move
 
quickly.
 
Last
 
quarter,
 
we
 
did
 
say
 
6
 
satellites
 
per
 
month.
 
We
 
had
 
a
 
reference
 
to
 
during
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025.
 
Our
 
message
 
this
 
quarter
 
is
 
consistent
 
with
 
that.
 
We
 
just
 
are
 
more
 
precise
 
in
 
Q4.
 
So,
 
when
 
you're
 
trying
 
to
 
move
 
as
 
quickly
 
as
 
we
 
are
 
and
 
you're
 
manufacturing
 
at
 
the
 
pace
 
which
 
has
 
never
 
been
 
done
 
before,
 
ever.
 
This
 
is
 
novel.
 
It's
 
never
 
been
 
done.
 
You
 
look
 
at
 
your
 
ﬁnancing
 
needs
 
as
 
a
 
package
 
of
 
opportunity
 
and
 
you
 
sort
 
of
 
weigh
 
when
 
you
 
access
 
the
 
capital
 
markets
 
versus
 
other
 
alternatives,
 
while
 
always
 
prioritizing
 
the
 
prepayments
 
from
 
our
 
partners,
 
which
 
has
 
proven
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
great
 
structure.
 
So
 
that
 
kind
 
of
 
gives
 
you
 
a
 
ﬂavor.
 
We're
 
in
 
great
 
position
 
with
 
the
 
balance
 
sheet.
 
But
 
if
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
move
 
quickly
 
and
 
if
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
expedite
 
manufacturing,
 
like
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
today,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
that
 
balance
 
sheet
 
stays
 
incredibly
 
strong
 
in
 
what
 
we
 
all
 
know
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
volatile
 
macro
 
climate
 
for
 
the
 
markets
 
right
 
now.
 
So,
 
that's
 
how
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
it,
 
and
 
hopefully,
 
that's
 
responsive
 
to
 
your
 
question.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Caleb
 
Henry
 
with
 
Quilty
 
Space.
 
Caleb
 
Henry
 
A
 
couple
 
of
 
questions.
 
One
 
on
 
the
 
Ligado
 
spectrum
 
and
 
kind
 
of
 
how
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
implemented.
 
Am
 
I
 
right
 
in
 
thinking
 
that
 
that
 
will
 
require
 
some
 
sort
 
of
 
modiﬁcation
 
to
 
the
 
satellite,
 
like
 
a
 
hosted
 
payload
 
or
 
something?
 
And
 
if
 
so,
 
how
 
does
 
AST
 
plan
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
go
 
forward
 
with
 
that,
 
kind
 
of
 
introducing
 
that
 
new
 
spectrum?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
When
 
we
 
are
 
at
 
pace,
 
which
 
is
 
6
 
per
 
month,
 
that's
 
72
 
satellites
 
per
 
year,
 
and
 
our
 
basic
 
design
 
is
 
96
 
satellites
 
in
 
low
 
band,
 
96
 
satellites
 
in
 
mid-band.
 
We
 
already
 
have
 
in
 
our
 
ASICs
 
and
 
our
 
core
 
technology,
 
the
 
support
 
of
 
this
 
band
 
and
 
all
 
the
 
mid-band
 
spectrum
 
of
 
our
 
partner
 
operators.
 
So
 
the
 
MSS,
 
LS,
 
3GPP
 
spectrums
 
in
 
mid-band
 
are
 
already
 
part
 
of
 
our
 
design.
 
Caleb
 
Henry
 
Okay.
 
Great.
 
And
 
then
 
a
 
clariﬁcation
 
just
 
on
 
the
 
Barcelona
 
facility.
 
I
 
read
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
for
 
manufacturing
 
space,
 
but
 
it
 
wasn't
 
quite
 
clear
 
to
 
me
 
what
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
building.
 
Is
 
that
 
a
 
secondary
 
factory
 
for
 
manufacturing
 
satellites?
 
Is
 
that
 
gateways,
 
ASICs?
 
Can
 
you
 
provide
 
some
 
clarity
 
on
 
what
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
for?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
Our
 
focus
 
on
 
manufacturing
 
is
 
manufacturing
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
So,
 
95%
 
--
 
we're
 
95%
 
vertically
 
integrated,
 
all
 
the
 
parts,
 
ﬁnal
 
integration
 
testing,
 
it
 
happened
 
here
 
in
 
Texas.
 
We
 
are
 
approaching
 
0.5
 
million
 
square
 
feet
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
facility,
 
when
 
we
 
add
 
the
 
new
 
Barcelona
 
facility
 
and
 
the
 
new
 
Florida
 
facilities.
 
In
 
Spain,
 
we
 
do
 
build
 
certain
 
high
 
reliability
 
parts
 
that
 
are
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
central
 
unit,
 
but
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
get
 
integrated
 
here
 
in
 
--
 
ﬁnally
 
in
 
Texas
 
where
 
we
 
integrate
 
and
 
test
 
the
 
complete
 
spacecraft.
 
Caleb
 
Henry
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
my
 
last
 
question
 
was
 
just
 
on
 
gateways.
 
You
 
mentioned
 
looking
 
at
 
those
 
rolling
 
out,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
was
 
$10
 
million
 
expected
 
a
 
year.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
how
 
many
 
gateways
 
AST
 
will
 
have
 
up
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year
 
and
 
kind
 
of
 
how
 
that
 
plots
 
alongside
 
the
 
ramp-up
 
of
 
the
 
constellation?
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
need
 
of
 
x
 
number
 
of
 
gateways
 
per
 
satellite
 
or
 
something
 
to
 
that
 
eﬀect.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Caleb,
 
just
 
a
 
few
 
reminders
 
for
 
the
 
audience.
 
Because
 
our
 
satellites
 
are
 
large,
 
the
 
largest
 
ever
 
in
 
low
 
earth
 
orbit,
 
as
 
we
 
say,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
large
 
ﬁeld
 
of
 
view.
 
So
 
what
 
that
 
means
 
practically
 
is,
 
fewer
 
gateways
 
than
 
is
 
typical
 
in
 
a
 
constellation.
 
And
 
so,
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
we'll
 
have
 
4
 
or
 
more
 
gateways
 
we've
 
applied
 
for.
 
In
 
other
 
countries,
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
1
 
or
 
2.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
much
 
smaller
 
lift
 
on
 
the
 
ground
 
infrastructure
 
side,
 
and
 
it's
 
one
 
that
 
we've
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
operators
 
because
 
when
 
the
 
operators
 
roll
 
out
 
a
 
new
 
wireless
 
service,
 
they
 
are
 
accustomed
 
to
 
a
 
deployment
 
of
 
base
 
stations.
 
And
 
so
 
those
 
base
 
stations
 
are
 
integrated
 
into
 
our
 
centralized
 
gateways.
 
So,
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
all
 
of
 
it,
 
and
 
we
 
go
 
country
 
by
 
country,
 
there's
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
in
 
a
 
country,
 
bigger
 
countries
 
will
 
have
 
more.
 
In
 
Europe,
 
we've
 
got
 
a
 
--
 
more
 
of
 
a
 
continental
 
solution
 
that
 
manages
 
the
 
smaller
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
countries
 
individually.
 
And
 
so,
 
what
 
all
 
that
 
means
 
is,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
gateways
 
deployed
 
low-single-digit
 
millions
 
per
 
gateway
 
and
 
you
 
roll
 
that
 
up
 
and
 
we're
 
building
 
it
 
out
 
and
 
taking
 
orders
 
now.
 
So,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
how
 
many
 
we
 
have
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
we
 
won't
 
give
 
a
 
ﬁrm
 
target
 
on
 
that,
 
but
 
you've
 
heard
 
us
 
say
 
repeatedly,
 
U.S.,
 
Europe
 
and
 
Japan
 
are
 
our
 
priorities.
 
So
 
those
 
are
 
certainly
 
places
 
you'll
 
start
 
seeing
 
more
 
gateways
 
installed
 
faster.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Tim
 
Horan
 
with
 
Oppenheimer
 
&
 
Company.
 
Timothy
 
Horan
 
Can
 
you
 
give
 
us
 
an
 
update
 
when
 
you
 
might
 
--
 
well,
 
when
 
we
 
might
 
see
 
a
 
commercial
 
launch
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States?
 
And
 
have
 
you
 
worked
 
out
 
a
 
wholesale
 
agreement
 
yet
 
with
 
the
 
carriers
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
dividing
 
the
 
economics?
 
And
 
to
 
be
 
clear,
 
when
 
you
 
do
 
that
 
commercial
 
launch,
 
it
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
full
 
suite
 
of
 
services
 
that
 
you
 
mentioned?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
The
 
answer
 
is
 
yes.
 
We
 
did
 
announce
 
a
 
deﬁnitive
 
agreement
 
with
 
AT&T,
 
and
 
we're
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
details
 
for
 
the
 
commercial
 
agreement
 
with
 
Verizon.
 
And
 
the
 
idea
 
is
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
beta
 
service
 
sometime
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
this
 
year,
 
our
 
commercial
 
service
 
fully
 
open
 
for
 
consumers
 
sometime
 
during
 
early
 
2026.
 
And
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
--
 
and
 
on
 
our
 
plan,
 
it
 
is
 
for
 
this
 
service
 
to
 
be
 
text,
 
Internet
 
data,
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
applications
 
like
 
video
 
conferencing.
 
Timothy
 
Horan
 
Great.
 
And
 
just
 
out
 
of
 
curiosity,
 
why
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
you
 
need
 
the
 
Ligado
 
spectrum
 
when
 
you're
 
doing
 
spectrum
 
sharing?
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
you're
 
doing
 
spectrum
 
sharing
 
in
 
areas
 
primarily
 
where
 
they're
 
not
 
using
 
the
 
spectrum.
 
So,
 
I
 
guess,
 
can
 
you
 
just
 
maybe
 
elaborate
 
how
 
much
 
spectrum
 
you
 
expect
 
to
 
get
 
from
 
your
 
partners?
 
And
 
why
 
would
 
you
 
need
 
Ligado
 
if
 
you're
 
getting
 
enough
 
from
 
them?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
One
 
thing
 
that
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
recognize
 
that
 
we
 
don't
 
only
 
serve
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
absolutely
 
nothing.
 
When
 
you're
 
in
 
a
 
camping
 
location,
 
when
 
you're
 
in
 
a
 
remote
 
location,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
serve
 
the
 
consumer
 
wherever
 
their
 
service
 
is
 
not
 
good
 
enough
 
or
 
is
 
not
 
supporting
 
a
 
full
 
5G
 
experience
 
for
 
the
 
end
 
user.
 
So,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
support
 
that,
 
you
 
need
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
capacity
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
basically
 
ﬁll
 
up
 
what
 
we
 
call
 
the
 
imperfections
 
of
 
the
 
network.
 
And
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
overlap
 
terrestrial
 
and
 
satellite
 
over
 
the
 
same
 
footprint.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
traﬃc
 
that
 
make
 
that
 
possible.
 
So,
 
with
 
the
 
low-band
 
spectrum,
 
we
 
get
 
access
 
to,
 
we
 
call
 
it
 
premium
 
spectrum
 
with
 
great
 
penetration,
 
go
 
through
 
trees,
 
it
 
goes
 
through
 
walls,
 
it
 
goes
 
through
 
cars
 
and
 
it's
 
available
 
in
 
every
 
phone.
 
But
 
there's
 
typically
 
limitations
 
on
 
how
 
much
 
spectrum
 
you
 
can
 
allocate
 
in
 
low
 
band.
 
So,
 
it's
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
--
 
I
 
mean,
 
like
 
historically,
 
operators
 
have
 
deployed
 
spectrum,
 
they
 
always
 
start
 
with
 
the
 
lowest
 
spectrum
 
because
 
that's
 
the
 
one
 
that
 
provides
 
most
 
coverage,
 
better
 
penetration,
 
better
 
user
 
experience.
 
As
 
the
 
network
 
gets
 
ﬁlled
 
up
 
by
 
usage,
 
you
 
keep
 
adding
 
spectrum,
 
and
 
that's
 
--
 
you
 
go
 
back
 
in
 
time
 
and
 
when
 
it
 
happens
 
with
 
--
 
when
 
initially
 
cellular
 
network
 
were
 
originally
 
deployed,
 
they
 
always
 
start
 
in
 
the
 
low
 
band
 
and
 
then
 
keep
 
going
 
up
 
in
 
frequency
 
to
 
create
 
more
 
density.
 
And
 
that's
 
the
 
intent
 
of
 
our
 
planned
 
45-megahertz
 
band
 
is
 
to
 
basically
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
continue
 
adding
 
subscribers
 
for
 
our
 
network
 
partners.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Scott
 
Searle
 
with
 
ROTH
 
Capital.
 
Scott
 
Searle
 
Maybe
 
just
 
to
 
follow-up
 
on
 
the
 
Ligado
 
front.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
L-band
 
support
 
within
 
existing
 
cell
 
phones
 
in
 
North
 
America,
 
how
 
is
 
that
 
progressing?
 
From
 
day
 
1,
 
provided
 
you're
 
able
 
to
 
close
 
the
 
transaction,
 
how
 
long
 
does
 
it
 
take
 
before
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
large
 
supply
 
of
 
users
 
within
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
that
 
support
 
the
 
L-band
 
spectrum?
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
follow-up.
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
mean
 
the
 
--
 
currently,
 
the
 
L-band
 
is
 
already
 
in
 
the
 
Android
 
ecosystem.
 
Actually,
 
you
 
have
 
that
 
band
 
enabled
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
3GPP
 
standard.
 
We
 
anticipate,
 
with
 
the
 
support
 
of
 
AT&T,
 
Verizon,
 
Vodafone
 
and
 
50
 
operators
 
around
 
the
 
globe
 
that
 
we'll
 
beneﬁt
 
oﬀ
 
this
 
band.
 
We
 
anticipate
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
interactions
 
on
 
the
 
new
 
phones
 
for
 
the
 
phone,
 
be
 
available
 
with
 
the
 
full
 
band
 
in
 
every
 
phone.
 
So,
 
that's
 
the
 
reason
 
why
 
we
 
always
 
had
 
a
 
hybrid
 
approach
 
where
 
we
 
start
 
with
 
low
 
band,
 
where
 
we
 
get
 
the
 
advantage
 
of
 
it's
 
in
 
every
 
phone,
 
it
 
is
 
--
 
have
 
an
 
RF
 
performance
 
that
 
is
 
much
 
better,
 
maximize
 
coverage
 
and
 
then
 
add
 
the
 
L-band
 
in
 
the
 
tail
 
end
 
of
 
our
 
deployment.
 
Scott
 
Searle
 
Great.
 
Very
 
helpful.
 
And
 
if
 
I
 
could,
 
just
 
on
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government
 
and
 
budget
 
front,
 
defense
 
space
 
has
 
done
 
actually
 
very
 
well
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
whether
 
it's
 
continuing
 
resolution
 
or
 
the
 
projected
 
discretionary
 
budget,
 
I
 
guess,
 
for
 
ﬁscal
 
'26.
 
So
 
--
 
but
 
there
 
are
 
some
 
give
 
and
 
takes
 
there,
 
too,
 
because
 
like
 
FEMA
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
on
 
the
 
ropes.
 
So
 
I'm
 
wondering,
 
as
 
you
 
kind
 
of
 
look
 
at
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
opportunities
 
and
 
programs
 
and
 
discussions
 
you're
 
having,
 
whether
 
it's
 
PLEO
 
or
 
otherwise,
 
I'd
 
even
 
throw
 
FirstNet
 
into
 
the
 
mix
 
there,
 
a
 
huge
 
opportunity
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
support
 
Band
 
14.
 
How
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
the
 
gives
 
and
 
takes
 
between
 
what's
 
getting
 
funded,
 
what's
 
not
 
getting
 
funded,
 
and
 
you
 
guys
 
still
 
feel
 
very
 
comfortable
 
about
 
the
 
position
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government
 
opportunities.
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
mean
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
say,
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government
 
is
 
using
 
our
 
satellites
 
now.
 
So,
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
capability
 
that
 
they
 
get
 
from
 
our
 
technology?
 
It
 
is
 
actually
 
very,
 
very
 
clear
 
for
 
them
 
at
 
this
 
point.
 
That
 
has
 
been
 
resulted
 
in
 
6
 
programs
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
ongoing
 
with
 
them.
 
We
 
see
 
the
 
Golden
 
Dome
 
opportunity
 
as
 
an
 
opportunity
 
that
 
we
 
feel
 
very
 
strong
 
in
 
participating
 
as
 
the
 
government
 
is
 
already
 
using
 
our
 
satellites
 
for
 
applications
 
that
 
are
 
supported
 
for
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
that
 
program.
 
So,
 
a
 
portion
 
of
 
that
 
program
 
was
 
prioritized
 
by
 
the
 
government,
 
and
 
we
 
believe
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
opportunity
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
be
 
part
 
of
 
that.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
And
 
I
 
would
 
also,
 
Scott,
 
that
 
you've
 
seen
 
us
 
building
 
small
 
contracts
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
couple
 
of
 
quarters
 
with
 
them.
 
It's
 
been
 
pretty
 
broad-based
 
dialogue,
 
broad-based
 
early
 
contracts.
 
And
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
where
 
money
 
is
 
ﬂowing
 
and
 
where
 
it's
 
not,
 
one
 
good
 
example
 
is
 
the
 
DIU,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
contract
 
we
 
just
 
announced
 
today.
 
That's
 
one
 
area
 
that
 
just
 
received
 
another
 
incremental
 
large
 
increase
 
of
 
funding.
 
So,
 
we
 
think
 
it's
 
--
 
the
 
puts
 
and
 
takes
 
is
 
much
 
more
 
puts
 
than
 
takes,
 
of
 
course,
 
and
 
we're
 
a
 
novel
 
technology
 
that's
 
being
 
used,
 
as
 
Abel
 
said
 
today,
 
and
 
we're
 
on
 
the
 
short
 
list
 
as
 
we
 
have
 
conversations,
 
and
 
we
 
see
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
positive
 
momentum,
 
broad-based,
 
but
 
also
 
in
 
places
 
that
 
are
 
receiving
 
more
 
funding
 
and
 
incremental
 
funding
 
even
 
recently.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
with
 
Deutsche
 
Bank.
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
I
 
had
 
2
 
if
 
I
 
could.
 
First
 
question,
 
how
 
many
 
satellites
 
will
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
5
 
launches
 
this
 
year
 
actually
 
include,
 
roughly?
 
And
 
is
 
that
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
launch
 
providers
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
1
 
particular
 
launch
 
provider
 
that's
 
doing
 
all
 
of
 
those
 
or
 
most
 
of
 
them?
 
And
 
I
 
guess,
 
just
 
a
 
high-level
 
strategic
 
question.
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
just
 
talk
 
about
 
what
 
you
 
think
 
your
 
competitive
 
moat
 
looks
 
like
 
at
 
this
 
point?
 
I
 
mean,
 
obviously
 
the
 
market,
 
while
 
encouraged
 
by
 
the
 
great
 
progress
 
that
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
made
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
years,
 
there's
 
always
 
this
 
concern
 
about
 
another
 
company
 
or
 
companies
 
eﬀectively
 
competing
 
with
 
you,
 
maybe
 
with
 
a
 
much
 
larger
 
ﬂeet
 
of
 
smaller
 
satellites.
 
So,
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
just
 
talk
 
about
 
that.
 
Would
 
love
 
to
 
hear
 
your
 
perspective
 
on
 
it.
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
will
 
say
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
competitive
 
landscape,
 
what
 
has
 
been
 
proven
 
possible
 
by
 
any
 
other
 
system
 
is
 
simply
 
text
 
messaging.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
capability
 
that
 
is
 
way
 
beyond
 
that
 
and
 
that
 
it
 
basically
 
goes
 
from
 
text,
 
voice,
 
data,
 
Internet
 
and
 
video.
 
So
 
--
 
and
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
limitation
 
of
 
what
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
with
 
smaller
 
satellites.
 
That's
 
basically
 
physics.
 
There's
 
also
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
inherent
 
problems
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
thousands
 
of
 
satellites,
 
the
 
revisit
 
time,
 
these
 
handovers
 
and
 
basically
 
just
 
the
 
practicality
 
of
 
the
 
phone
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
connect
 
to
 
a
 
smaller
 
satellite.
 
So,
 
I
 
think
 
at
 
this
 
point,
 
it's
 
been
 
proved,
 
what
 
the
 
industry
 
has
 
been
 
--
 
historically
 
been
 
capable
 
of
 
doing.
 
Our
 
capability
 
has
 
been
 
supported
 
by
 
the
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
operators
 
is
 
a
 
capability
 
for
 
broadband.
 
And
 
we
 
think
 
that
 
our
 
capability
 
is
 
very
 
diﬀerentiated.
 
And
 
it's
 
a
 
capability
 
that
 
is
 
also
 
dual
 
use.
 
That
 
means
 
--
 
what
 
we
 
mean
 
by
 
dual
 
use
 
is
 
used
 
by
 
governments,
 
particularly
 
our
 
government
 
and
 
the
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
network
 
operators
 
around
 
the
 
globe.
 
We
 
have
 
access
 
through
 
the
 
agreement
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
with
 
operators
 
today,
 
we
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
billions
 
of
 
subscribers
 
provided
 
that
 
we
 
build
 
enough
 
capacity
 
for
 
them.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
build
 
our
 
portfolio
 
of
 
spectrum
 
starting
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
Appreciate
 
that
 
thoughtful
 
answer.
 
And
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
say
 
anything
 
around
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
5
 
launches
 
and
 
how
 
many
 
satellites
 
that
 
will
 
encompass
 
and
 
whether
 
that's
 
a
 
single
 
launch
 
provider
 
providing
 
those
 
ﬁrst
 
5
 
or
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
providers?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Bryan,
 
our
 
strategy
 
has
 
been
 
multi-operator
 
all
 
along,
 
launch
 
vehicle
 
agnostic
 
all
 
along.
 
And
 
so
 
these
 
early
 
launches,
 
we
 
expect
 
will
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
that
 
strategy.
 
We
 
do
 
have
 
some
 
ﬂexibility.
 
These
 
things
 
are
 
a
 
little
 
dynamic.
 
So
 
we
 
can't
 
make
 
ﬁrm
 
commitments
 
on
 
all
 
of
 
it.
 
But
 
in
 
aggregate,
 
we
 
feel
 
that
 
the
 
timeline
 
we
 
laid
 
out
 
makes
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
sense.
 
So
 
5
 
launches
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
6
 
to
 
9
 
months.
 
And
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
one,
 
of
 
course
 
will
 
only
 
have
 
1
 
satellite.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
earlier
 
launches
 
will
 
have
 
fewer
 
than
 
full
 
capacity.
 
But
 
we'd
 
really
 
like
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
position
 
to
 
have
 
20
 
satellites
 
up
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
we
 
can
 
thereabouts.
 
But
 
we're
 
doing
 
everything
 
we
 
can
 
to
 
keep
 
moving
 
to
 
the
 
left
 
on
 
time.
 
We're
 
overproducing
 
with
 
our
 
factory
 
for
 
sure,
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we're
 
not
 
the
 
long
 
pole.
 
And
 
we've
 
been
 
very
 
proactive
 
on
 
this
 
multi-operator
 
--
 
multi-launch
 
provider
 
strategy.
 
So
 
that's
 
kind
 
of
 
how
 
we're
 
thinking
 
about
 
it,
 
Bryan,
 
and
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
--
 
we'll
 
play
 
it
 
out
 
month
 
by
 
month
 
and
 
quarter-by-quarter
 
and
 
give
 
you
 
better
 
updates,
 
but
 
we're
 
pushing
 
hard
 
on
 
this
 
because
 
we
 
know
 
that
 
we'll
 
have
 
the
 
satellites
 
to
 
launch
 
when
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
vehicles
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
orbit.
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
And
 
as
 
a
 
guidance,
 
I
 
mean,
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
vehicle,
 
you're
 
talking
 
about
 
3
 
to
 
4
 
vehicles
 
per
 
satellite
 
or
 
8
 
vehicles
 
per
 
satellite.
 
And
 
as
 
a
 
reminder,
 
these
 
are
 
very
 
large
 
satellites.
 
I
 
mean
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
largest
 
ever
 
satellite
 
launched
 
for
 
communication.
 
So,
 
typically,
 
we
 
try
 
to
 
--
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
launch,
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
single
 
launch
 
given
 
the
 
vehicle
 
that
 
we're
 
using.
 
But
 
our
 
launch
 
contract
 
support
 
3
 
to
 
4
 
on
 
the
 
smaller
 
vehicles
 
and
 
8
 
in
 
the
 
bulk
 
of
 
the
 
launch
 
agreements
 
that
 
we
 
have.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Chris
 
Quilty
 
with
 
Quilty
 
Space.
 
Christopher
 
Quilty
 
Didn't
 
expect
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
second
 
bite
 
at
 
the
 
apple,
 
but
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
follow
 
up
 
on
 
the
 
Block
 
2
 
Bluebird
 
launch.
 
Should
 
we
 
view
 
that
 
--
 
is
 
that
 
a
 
fully
 
operational
 
oﬀ
 
the
 
production
 
line
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
still
 
being
 
viewed
 
as
 
more
 
of
 
a
 
pathﬁnder
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
testing
 
the
 
unfurling
 
mechanism
 
and
 
other
 
aspects
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
bled
 
into
 
the
 
production?
 
Is
 
it
 
more
 
the
 
former
 
than
 
the
 
latter?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
No,
 
no,
 
it's
 
a
 
full-blown
 
operational
 
satellite.
 
It
 
does
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
microns,
 
which
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
is
 
the
 
building
 
block
 
of
 
the
 
phase
 
array.
 
Exact
 
same
 
models
 
that
 
we
 
use
 
on
 
the
 
Block
 
1
 
satellites,
 
which
 
we
 
have
 
now
 
in
 
operation.
 
But
 
of
 
course,
 
it's
 
larger.
 
It's
 
3.5x
 
larger
 
than
 
the
 
Block
 
1
 
satellites.
 
But
 
it's
 
come
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
production
 
line.
 
And
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
we're
 
producing
 
--
 
we're
 
launching
 
FM1,
 
but
 
we
 
are
 
producing
 
40
 
satellites
 
this
 
year.
 
We
 
will
 
be
 
--
 
we
 
think
 
that
 
we
 
will
 
get
 
closer
 
to
 
53
 
satellites
 
worth
 
of
 
phase
 
arrays
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
So,
 
it's
 
coming
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
production
 
line.
 
It's
 
an
 
operational
 
satellite.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
constellation.
 
Christopher
 
Quilty
 
But
 
to
 
be
 
clear,
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
said
 
by
 
the
 
fourth
 
launch,
 
that
 
production
 
line
 
will
 
shift
 
from
 
FPGAs
 
to
 
ASICs,
 
correct?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes,
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
batches
 
are
 
FPGA.
 
Christopher
 
Quilty
 
Great.
 
Second
 
question,
 
real
 
quickly,
 
I
 
guess
 
in
 
the
 
press
 
release,
 
you
 
said
 
the
 
$50
 
million
 
to
 
$75
 
million
 
of
 
revenue
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
How
 
much
 
of
 
that
 
is
 
actual
 
service
 
type
 
revenue
 
versus
 
contractual
 
payments
 
as
 
milestones
 
with
 
customers?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Chris,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
a
 
big
 
contributor,
 
of
 
course,
 
is
 
our
 
government
 
business,
 
including
 
the
 
$43
 
million
 
SDA
 
contract
 
we
 
announced
 
last
 
quarter
 
and
 
is
 
milestone-based,
 
but
 
based
 
on
 
work
 
being
 
done
 
on
 
our
 
5
 
Block
 
1
 
satellites
 
and
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
Block
 
2
 
satellite.
 
So,
 
there's
 
a
 
good
 
portion
 
of
 
it
 
that
 
is
 
milestone
 
payments
 
and
 
there'll
 
probably
 
be
 
some
 
other
 
government
 
revenue
 
in
 
there.
 
But
 
there's
 
also
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
component
 
of
 
commercial
 
revenue
 
as
 
well,
 
with
 
early
 
activations,
 
and
 
importantly,
 
those
 
gateway
 
installations
 
we
 
walked
 
through
 
earlier
 
in
 
the
 
call.
 
So
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
balance.
 
Certainly,
 
government
 
is
 
a
 
big
 
contributor
 
of
 
our
 
early
 
revenue,
 
and
 
that's
 
primarily
 
milestone-based.
 
But
 
on
 
the
 
commercial
 
side,
 
you'll
 
see
 
both
 
the
 
gateway
 
installations
 
and
 
then
 
also
 
some
 
initial
 
activations,
 
we
 
think.
 
Christopher
 
Quilty
 
Got
 
you.
 
And
 
just
 
to
 
follow
 
up
 
on
 
the
 
gateways.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
the
 
guidance,
 
around
 
$10
 
million
 
a
 
quarter.
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
reason
 
that
 
should
 
ever
 
accelerate?
 
Or
 
is
 
that
 
a
 
good
 
run
 
rate
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
expect
 
as
 
we
 
look
 
out
 
the
 
next
 
year
 
and
 
the
 
year
 
after?
 
And
 
fair
 
to
 
assume
 
that
 
you're
 
running
 
that
 
mostly
 
as
 
a
 
loss
 
leader,
 
not
 
a
 
proﬁt
 
center
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
how
 
we
 
should
 
model
 
the
 
margin
 
contribution?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes,
 
that's
 
correct.
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
gateway
 
is
 
just
 
an
 
enabler.
 
I
 
mean
 
we're
 
taking
 
--
 
basically,
 
the
 
gateway
 
for
 
United
 
States
 
are
 
ready
 
to
 
operations.
 
So
 
then
 
the
 
JV
 
in
 
Europe
 
is
 
taking
 
up
 
the
 
initial
 
activations
 
that
 
we've
 
been
 
using
 
actually
 
for
 
the
 
initial
 
activation
 
that
 
we
 
had,
 
in
 
particular
 
in
 
the
 
U.K.
 
So
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
shared
 
infrastructure
 
in
 
Europe.
 
And
 
then
 
Japan
 
is
 
also
 
partially
 
activated.
 
We
 
have
 
multiple
 
gateways;
 
we
 
have
 
one
 
in
 
operations
 
now.
 
So,
 
as
 
we
 
said,
 
initial
 
focus
 
is
 
U.S.,
 
Europe,
 
Japan
 
and
 
then
 
some
 
selected
 
markets
 
where
 
we're
 
getting
 
payments,
 
prepayments
 
from
 
MNOs.
 
And
 
to
 
put
 
it
 
in
 
perspective,
 
U.S.
 
is
 
4
 
gateways;
 
a
 
large
 
country
 
like
 
Brazil
 
is
 
3
 
gateways.
 
And
 
then,
 
block
 
of
 
smaller
 
countries
 
are
 
shared
 
infrastructure
 
in
 
Europe.
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
And
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
modeling,
 
Chris,
 
I
 
would
 
add,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
margin
 
on
 
those.
 
It's
 
a
 
low
 
margin.
 
We
 
view
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
enable
 
the
 
service,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
loss
 
leader.
 
And
 
second,
 
we
 
think
 
there's
 
upside
 
to
 
that
 
quarterly
 
guidance
 
we
 
gave,
 
for
 
sure.
 
But
 
note
 
that
 
these
 
can
 
be
 
lumpy
 
as
 
well.
 
So
 
we
 
wanted
 
to
 
be
 
conservative
 
as
 
we
 
started
 
talking
 
about
 
this
 
metric.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
with
 
Cantor
 
Fitzgerald.
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
Just
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
DIU
 
contract.
 
Maybe
 
talk
 
about
 
kind
 
of
 
how
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
that
 
as
 
a
 
task
 
order
 
of
 
a
 
larger
 
contract
 
or
 
if
 
that's
 
the
 
ceiling
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
contract?
 
And
 
then
 
maybe
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
conversations
 
that
 
you've
 
had
 
with
 
folks
 
like
 
Lockheed,
 
you
 
have
 
former
 
American
 
Tower
 
Corp
 
executives
 
that
 
are
 
leading
 
the
 
company
 
and
 
maybe
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
other
 
primes?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Colin,
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
on
 
the
 
DIU,
 
this
 
is
 
--
 
they
 
recently
 
received
 
$2
 
billion
 
of
 
additional
 
funding.
 
This
 
is
 
deﬁnitely
 
a
 
place
 
where
 
the
 
government
 
is
 
looking
 
to
 
support
 
new
 
technologies
 
and
 
move
 
fast
 
with
 
them.
 
The
 
way
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
it
 
is
 
that
 
it's
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
an
 
incubation
 
place
 
where
 
a
 
broad
 
base
 
of
 
diﬀerent
 
government
 
agencies
 
can
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
tech
 
across
 
diﬀerent
 
types
 
of
 
applications
 
and
 
it's
 
a
 
good
 
place
 
to
 
get
 
projects
 
moving
 
fast.
 
So,
 
I
 
think
 
on
 
the
 
one
 
side,
 
think
 
of
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
place
 
to
 
germinate
 
new
 
use
 
cases
 
for
 
us,
 
but
 
it's
 
also
 
a
 
place
 
to
 
accelerate
 
use
 
cases
 
we've
 
been
 
discussing
 
that
 
maybe
 
just
 
didn't
 
hit
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
half
 
a
 
dozen
 
in
 
our
 
priority
 
conversations.
 
So
 
these
 
are
 
--
 
and
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
dollar
 
amount,
 
I
 
gave
 
some
 
guidance
 
on
 
low
 
tens
 
of
 
millions
 
potential,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
set
 
a
 
$20
 
million
 
ceiling.
 
Some
 
of
 
these
 
are
 
a
 
little
 
artiﬁcial
 
relative
 
to
 
how
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
contracts
 
get
 
initially
 
awarded.
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
great
 
place
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
push
 
the
 
use
 
cases
 
across
 
a
 
broad
 
reach
 
within
 
the
 
DoD
 
and
 
beyond.
 
Operator
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
reached
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
question-and-answer
 
session.
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
turn
 
the
 
ﬂoor
 
back
 
to
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
for
 
closing
 
remarks.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
operator.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
thank
 
everyone
 
for
 
their
 
questions,
 
all
 
shareholders
 
and
 
the
 
research
 
analysts
 
that
 
joined
 
the
 
call.
 
We
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
providing
 
more
 
updates
 
in
 
the
 
future,
 
and
 
stay
 
tuned.
 
Operator
 
Thank
 
you.
 
And
 
this
 
concludes
 
today's
 
conference,
 
and
 
you
 
may
 
disconnect
 
your
 
lines
 
at
 
this
 
time.
 
We
 
thank
 
you
 
for
 
your
 
participation,
 
and
 
have
 
a
 
great
 
day.
