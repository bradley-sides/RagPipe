Our
 
Q3
 
revenue
 
was
 
$21.7
 
million,
 
within
 
prior
 
guidance
 
and
 
also
 
a
 
record
 
quarter
 
for
 
GaN
 
shipments.
 
I'm
 
excited
 
to
 
announce
 
a
 
major
 
new
 
technology
 
launch,
 
several
 
very
 
important
 
customer
 
events
 
and
 
2
 
new
 
significant
 
corporate
 
announcements.
 
Navitas
 
is
 
the
 
pioneer
 
and
 
leader
 
in
 
GaN
 
technology,
 
releasing
 
the
 
world's
 
first
 
GaN
 
power
 
ICs
 
and
 
driving
 
the
 
world's
 
first
 
mainstream
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
in
 
mobile
 
fast
 
chargers
 
starting
 
back
 
in
 
2018.
 
Navitas
 
GaN
 
ICs
 
continue
 
to
 
be
 
generations
 
ahead
 
of
 
our
 
competitors.
 
Our
 
ICs
 
set
 
new
 
industry
 
standards
 
for
 
integration,
 
efficiency,
 
performance,
 
reliability,
 
and
 
ease
 
of
 
use.
 
Now
 
we're
 
expanding
 
power
 
capabilities
 
into
 
AI
 
data
 
centers,
 
EV
 
chargers
 
and
 
next-generation
 
solar
 
microinverters,
 
including
 
our
 
latest
 
GaNSafe
 
family,
 
the
 
world's
 
most
 
protected
 
and
 
reliable
 
GaN
 
power
 
platform.
 
Today,
 
we're
 
proud
 
to
 
announce
 
a
 
new
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
technology
 
optimized
 
for
 
48-volt
 
systems,
 
giving

next-generation
 
EV
 
platforms
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
opening
 
up
 
new
 
markets
 
like
 
AI-based
 
robotics.
 
We
 
believe
 
this
 
new
 
80
 
to
 
200-volt
 
range
 
creates
 
an
 
additional
 
$1
 
billion
 
market
 
opportunity
 
for
 
Navitas
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
years.
 
I'm
 
also
 
pleased
 
to
 
announce
 
a
 
strategic
 
partnership
 
with
 
Infineon
 
in
 
which
 
the
 
2
 
companies
 
are
 
creating
 
common
 
GaN
 
specifications,
 
giving
 
our
 
customers
 
dual
 
sourcing
 
options
 
from
 
our
 
two
 
companies.
 
With
 
Navitas
 
and
 
Infineon
 
aligning
 
on
 
fundamental
 
elements
 
such
 
as
 
packaging,
 
pinout,
 
footprint
 
and
 
intellectual
 
property,
 
customers
 
will
 
have
 
increased
 
confidence
 
to
 
accelerate
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
into
 
new
 
high-volume
 
mainstream
 
applications.
 
This
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
platform
 
is
 
another
 
significant
 
step
 
in
 
Navitas'
 
pure-play
 
technology
 
roadmap
 
of
 
next-gen
 
integrated
 
GaN
 
and
 
leading-edge
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
with
 
proprietary
 
trench-assisted
 
planar
 
technology
 
for
 
no
 
compromise
 
high-efficiency,
 
high-power
 
density
 
solutions.
 
Continued
 
innovation
 
across
 
a
 
broad
 
range
 
of
 
platforms
 
has
 
now
 
increased
 
Navitas
 
portfolio
 
to
 
over
 
300
 
patents
 
granted
 
or
 
pending,
 
expanding
 
another
 
key
 
element
 
of
 
our
 
significant
 
competitive
 
advantages.
 
Next,
 
let
 
me
 
turn
 
to
 
our
 
progress
 
in
 
each
 
of
 
our
 
target
 
markets.
 
In
 
AI
 
and
 
enterprise
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
in
 
step
 
with
 
NVIDIA's
 
rack
 
power
 
demands
 
for
 
the
 
Hopper
 
Blackwell
 
Ruben
 
GPU
 
road
 
map
 
demanding
 
up
 
to
 
480
 
kilowatts
 
per
 
rack,
 
we've
 
announced
 
a
 
new
 
record-breaking
 
8.5
 
kilowatt
 
AI
 
power
 
supply
 
design,
 
utilizing
 
a
 
winning
 
combination
 
of
 
GaNSafe
 
and
 
Gen
 
3
 
Fast
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technology
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
our
 
new
 
InteliWave
 
architecture
 
that
 
achieves
 
over
 
99%
 
peak
 
efficiency
 
for
 
data
 
center
 
PFC
 
applications.
 
Our
 
high-voltage
 
GaNSafe
 
power
 
ICs
 
and
 
Gen
 
3
 
fast
 
silicon

devices
 
are
 
featured
 
in
 
over
 
60
 
active
 
customer
 
projects
 
with
 
direct
 
customers
 
like
 
Delta,
 
Great
 
Wall,
 
Compuware
 
and
 
LiteON,
 
supplying
 
end
 
users
 
like
 
AWS,
 
Azure
 
and
 
Google.
 
Our
 
data
 
center
 
revenue
 
started
 
in
 
Q3
 
as
 
expected
 
and
 
will
 
continue
 
ramping
 
this
 
quarter
 
and
 
throughout
 
2025.
 
The
 
new
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
technology
 
announced
 
today
 
is
 
a
 
perfect
 
complement
 
to
 
our
 
existing
 
high-voltage
 
GaN.
 
In
 
particular,
 
for
 
AI
 
data
 
centers,
 
this
 
allows
 
Navitas
 
to
 
deliver
 
end-to-end
 
solutions
 
from
 
high-voltage
 
AC
 
to
 
DC
 
converters
 
with
 
our
 
existing
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technologies
 
to
 
low-voltage
 
DC
 
to
 
DC
 
converters
 
using
 
these
 
new
 
80
 
to
 
200-volt
 
GaN
 
devices.
 
These
 
technologies
 
are
 
a
 
critical
 
element
 
for
 
the
 
recent
 
exponential
 
demands
 
and
 
AI
 
power
 
requirements
 
to
 
boost
 
energy
 
efficiencies
 
and
 
power
 
densities
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
target
 
a
 
doubling
 
of
 
rack
 
power
 
every
 
year
 
for
 
many
 
years
 
to
 
come.
 
Sampling
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
will
 
start
 
this
 
quarter
 
for
 
48-volt
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
other
 
markets
 
with
 
first
 
customer
 
designs
 
expected
 
to
 
ramp
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025.
 
In
 
electric
 
vehicles,
 
based
 
on
 
our
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
best-in-class
 
in-circuit
 
performance,
 
we
 
have
 
won
 
another
 
6
 
designs
 
in
 
Q3,
 
including
 
both
 
onboard
 
chargers
 
and
 
roadside
 
chargers
 
for
 
2025
 
and
 
2026
 
revenue
 
ramps.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
performance
 
benefits,
 
our
 
trench-assisted
 
planar
 
GeneSiC
 
devices
 
are
 
fully
 
qualified
 
to
 
industry
 
AECQ-101
 
grade,
 
and
 
we're
 
extending
 
those
 
tests
 
well
 
beyond
 
AEC
 
standards
 
for
 
best-in-class
 
reliability.
 
EV
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
largest
 
segment
 
in
 
our
 
customer
 
pipeline
 
with
 
over
 
200
 
active
 
projects.
 
In
 
addition,
 
our
 
new
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
technology
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
perfect
 
fit
 
for
 
48-volt
 
battery
 
EV
 
applications
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
Navitas
 
continues
 
to
 
drive
 
excellence
 
in
 
the
 
mobile
 
and
 
consumer
 
market
 
with
 
GaN
 
Slim
 
ICs
 
featured
 
in
 
another
 
26
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
Q3.
 
Adding
 
to
 
the
 
Samsung
 
wins
 
we
 
announced
 
in
 
August,
 
we
 
now
 
have
 
another
 
3
 
Tier
 
1
 
OEM
 
wins,
 
which
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
deliver
 
multimillion
 
starting
 
to
 
ramp
 
in
 
Q2
 
of
 
next
 
year.
 
In
 
the
 
appliance
 
and
 
industrial
 
pipeline,
 
30
 
new
 
design
 
wins
 
were
 
achieved
 
in
 
Q3,
 
ranging
 
from
 
vacuum
 
cleaners
 
and
 
LED
 
lighting
 
to
 
solid-state
 
grid-connected
 
circuit
 
breakers,
 
multi-kilowatt
 
power
 
supplies
 
and
 
heat
 
pumps.
 
In
 
solar
 
and
 
energy,
 
we
 
added
 
another
 
10
 
design
 
wins,
 
including
 
a
 
multimillion
 
dollar
 
win
 
at
 
Generac,
 
which
 
is
 
scheduled
 
to
 
start
 
production
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
of
 
next
 
year.
 
Next-gen
 
GaN
 
ICs,
 
including
 
Navitas
 
proprietary
 
industry-leading
 
bidirectional
 
GaN
 
ICs
 
continue
 
to
 
track
 
for
 
a
 
significant
 
mid-'25
 
ramp
 
in
 
solar
 
microinverters.
 
Our
 
new
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
will
 
also
 
provide
 
further
 
opportunities
 
in
 
solar
 
in
 
the
 
low-voltage
 
panel
 
side
 
of
 
these
 
inverters
 
as
 
a
 
perfect
 
complement
 
to
 
our
 
high-voltage
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide,
 
doubling
 
our
 
content
 
potential
 
in
 
these
 
applications.
 
Today,
 
we're
 
also
 
announcing
 
some
 
important
 
changes
 
to
 
streamline
 
our
 
company
 
and
 
drive
 
important
 
efficiency
 
gains
 
with
 
the
 
goal
 
of
 
scaling
 
our
 
company
 
to
 
profitability.
 
As
 
Todd
 
will
 
further
 
explain,
 
we
 
have
 
reduced
 
headcount
 
and
 
expenses,
 
which
 
will
 
reduce
 
our
 
revenue
 
threshold
 
for
 
positive
 
EBITDA
 
and
 
accelerate
 
our
 
time
 
to
 
profitability.
 
We've
 
also
 
increased
 
our
 
organizational
 
focus
 
on
 
our
 
3
 
most
 
strategic
 
markets,
 
AI
 
data
 
center,
 
mobile,
 
and
 
EV.
 
We
 
believe
 
these
 
three
 
markets,
 
utilizing
 
our
 
industry-leading
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technology,
 
along
 
with
 
complementary
 
silicon
 
controllers
 
and
 
isolators
 
will
 
be
 
our
 
largest
 
revenue
 
drivers
 
over
 
the
 
coming
 
years.
 
The
 
technologies
 
we
 
create
 
for
 
these
 
markets
 
will
 
have
 
significant
 
opportunities
 
for
 
cross-selling
 
into
 
industrial,
 
appliance,
 
consumer,
 
solar,
 
and
 
energy
 
storage
 
markets.
 
Looking
 
forward,
 
given
 
continued
 
softness
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
end
 
markets,
 
combined
 
with
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
customer
 
project
 
delays,
 
we
 
anticipate
 
a
 
more
 
muted
 
outlook
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
couple
 
of
 
quarters.
 
However,
 
with
 
the
 
strength
 
of
 
our
 
$1.6
 
billion
 
plus
 
customer
 
pipeline
 
and
 
continued
 
design
 
win
 
momentum,
 
we
 
expect
 
solid
 
growth
 
to
 
resume
 
later
 
next
 
year.
 
In
 
addition,
 
today's
 
announcements
 
of
 
our
 
new
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
technology,
 
a
 
dual
 
sourcing
 
partnership
 
with
 
Infineon
 
and
 
creation
 
of
 
a
 
more
 
efficient
 
and
 
focused
 
organization
 
all
 
set
 
Navitas
 
on
 
an
 
improved
 
path
 
to
 
growth
 
and
 
profitability.
 
Now
 
over
 
to
 
Todd
 
for
 
our
 
financial
 
updates.
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Gene.
 
I'm
 
just
 
as
 
excited
 
today
 
to
 
be
 
talking
 
to
 
you
 
all
 
as
 
I
 
was
 
in
 
2022.
 
Navitas
 
has
 
proven
 
world-class
 
technology,
 
strong
 
secular
 
trends
 
driving
 
gallium
 
nitride
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
to
 
replace
 
silicon,
 
a
 
seasoned
 
leadership
 
team
 
with
 
plenty
 
of
 
experience
 
in
 
semi
 
cycles
 
and
 
a
 
fabless
 
model
 
that
 
provides
 
important
 
flexibility
 
to
 
navigate
 
these
 
choppy
 
waters.
 
As
 
we
 
expand
 
into
 
new
 
markets,
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
further
 
diversify
 
our
 
revenue
 
stream
 
from
 
mobile
 
chargers
 
into
 
multiple
 
high-growth
 
markets
 
with
 
an
 
increased
 
focus
 
on
 
EV
 
and
 
AI
 
data
 
centers.
 
I'll
 
continue
 
my
 
comments
 
today
 
with
 
a
 
review
 
of
 
our
 
third
 
quarter
 
financial
 
results,
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
outlook
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter.
 
Revenue
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024
 
was
 
$21.7
 
million,
 
essentially
 
flat
 
with
 
prior
 
year
 
and
 
a
 
6%
 
sequential
 
quarter
 
increase.
 
As
 
Gene
 
discussed,
 
macroeconomics
 
continues
 
to
 
impact
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
our
 
end
 
markets.
 
However,
 
our
 
mobile
 
business
 
hit
 
an
 
all-time
 
record
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter.
 
Before
 
addressing
 
expenses,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
you
 
to
 
the
 
GAAP
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
reconciliations
 
in
 
our
 
press
 
release
 
earlier
 
today.
 
In
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
my
 
commentary,
 
I
 
will
 
refer
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
expense
 
measures.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
was
 
40.1%
 
compared
 
to
 
42.1%
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
of
 
2023
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
strong
 
mobile
 
market
 
mix.
 
Sequentially,
 
gross
 
margin
 
was
 
relatively
 
flat
 
from
 
40.3%
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter.
 
While
 
gross
 
margin
 
expanded
 
in
 
our
 
mobile
 
market
 
and
 
supply
 
chain
 
cost
 
reductions
 
are
 
allowing
 
us
 
increased
 
competitiveness
 
with
 
silicon,
 
sequential
 
product
 
mix
 
is
 
offsetting
 
that
 
growth
 
in
 
gross
 
margin.
 
We
 
held
 
total
 
operating
 
expenses
 
for
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
relatively
 
flat
 
sequentially
 
at
 
$21.4
 
million,
 
comprised
 
of
 
SG&A
 
expenses
 
of
 
$9.9
 
million
 
and
 
R&D
 
expenses
 
of
 
$11.6
 
million,
 
demonstrating
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
balance
 
operating
 
efficiency
 
while
 
investing
 
in
 
future
 
product
 
generations.
 
Adding
 
all
 
this
 
together,
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
2024
 
loss
 
from
 
operations
 
was
 
$12.7
 
million.
 
Our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
for
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
was
 
185
 
million
 
shares.
 
Turning
 
to
 
the
 
balance
 
sheet.
 
It
 
remains
 
very
 
strong
 
with
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
liquidity.
 
Cash
 
and
 
cash
 
equivalents
 
at
 
quarter
 
end
 
were
 
$99
 
million,
 
and
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
carry
 
no
 
debt.
 
Although
 
accounts
 
receivable
 
increased
 
to
 
$26
 
million
 
compared
 
to
 
$23
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
prior
 
quarter,
 
we
 
made
 
good
 
progress
 
on
 
reducing
 
inventory
 
to
 
$21
 
million
 
from
 
$25
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
prior
 
quarter.
 
As
 
we've
 
discussed
 
in
 
past
 
earnings
 
calls,
 
we
 
are
 
continuing
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
working
 
capital
 
improvements.
 
Moving
 
on
 
to
 
guidance
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter.
 
We
 
currently
 
expect
 
revenues
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
$18
 
million
 
to
 
$20
 
million,
 
reflecting
 
the
 
dynamic
 
nature
 
and
 
short
 
lead
 
times
 
for
 
mobile
 
business
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
customer
 
project
 
delays,
 
as
 
Gene
 
described.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
with
 
our
 
guidance
 
at
 
40%,
 
plus
 
or
 
minus
 
50
 
basis
 
points
 
as
 
our
 
mix
 
continues
 
to
 
lean
 
toward
 
the
 
mobile
 
market
 
in
 
the
 
near
 
term.
 
We
 
expect
 
margin
 
improvement
 
will
 
align
 
with
 
demand
 
recovery
 
in
 
higher
 
power
 
markets.
 
As
 
Gene
 
described,
 
in
 
Q4,
 
we
 
initiated
 
a
 
reduction
 
in
 
headcount
 
and
 
expenses
 
while
 
streamlining
 
our
 
organization
 
and
 
increasing
 
our
 
focus
 
on
 
our
 
most
 
strategic
 
revenue
 
drivers.
 
Headcount
 
was
 
reduced
 
by
 
about
 
14%
 
or
 
45
 
employees,
 
and
 
we
 
expect
 
OpEx
 
reduction
 
of
 
approximately
 
$2
 
million
 
per
 
quarter
 
that
 
should
 
be
 
fully
 
realized
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
half
 
of
 
2025.
 
Our
 
non-GAAP
 
operating
 
expenses
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
decline
 
to
 
approximately
 
$20.5
 
million.
 
For
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024,
 
we
 
expect
 
our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
187
 
million
 
shares.
 
In
 
closing,
 
while
 
we
 
are
 
excited
 
about
 
the
 
growth
 
opportunities
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
us,
 
we
 
are
 
thoughtfully
 
navigating
 
near-term
 
uncertainties
 
that
 
are
 
impacting
 
the
 
entire
 
semiconductor
 
industry.
 
Navitas
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
pure-play
 
next-generation
 
power
 
semiconductor
 
company,
 
and
 
this
 
provides
 
us
 
with
 
advantages,
 
opportunities,
 
and
 
benefits
 
for
 
significant
 
expansion.
 
Operator,
 
let's
 
begin
 
the
 
Q&A
 
session.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
Our
 
first
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
from
 
Rosenblatt.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
Yes,
 
very
 
interesting
 
on
 
the
 
dual
 
source
 
below-voltage
 
GaN
 
platform
 
agreement.
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
IP
 
licensing
 
in
 
this?
 
And
 
maybe
 
another
 
question
 
I
 
have
 
is,
 
is
 
this
 
driven
 
by
 
customer
 
requests?
 
Or
 
is
 
this
 
more
 
driven
 
by
 
the
 
2
 
companies
 
you
 
and
 
Infineon
 
saying
 
that
 
this
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
value
 
add
 
to
 
our
 
customers?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Kevin.
 
Good
 
question.
 
So
 
yes,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
cross-license.
 
It's
 
a
 
broad-based
 
GaN
 
cross-license.
 
So
 
that
 
gives
 
us
 
both
 
the
 
freedom
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
collaboration
 
like
 
this
 
and
 
gives
 
our
 
customers
 
the
 
confidence
 
that
 
this
 
collaboration
 
will
 
be
 
free
 
of
 
any
 
sort
 
of
 
patent
 
conflict
 
between
 
the
 
2.
 
And
 
why
 
do
 
we
 
do
 
it?
 
I
 
think
 
2
 
reasons.
 
One,
 
we've
 
certainly
 
seen
 
with
 
GaN
 
ICs,
 
people
 
love
 
the
 
technology.
 
They
 
love
 
that
 
advanced
 
technology,
 
but
 
they
 
really
 
don't
 
like
 
sole
 
sourcing.
 
And
 
so
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
faster.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
into
 
mainstream,
 
high-volume
 
markets
 
quicker.
 
If
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
with
 
2
 
credible
 
high-quality
 
suppliers
 
with
 
common
 
specs,
 
common
 
footprints,
 
things
 
can
 
go
 
a
 
lot
 
faster.
 
This
 
has
 
been
 
proven
 
in
 
the
 
industry.
 
It's
 
been
 
done
 
many
 
times.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
really
 
well
 
for
 
us.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
Infineon
 
fits
 
our
 
kind
 
of
 
reputation
 
strategy
 
and
 
value-based
 
pricing.
 
I
 
also
 
think
 
we're
 
entering
 
the
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
market
 
pretty
 
recently,
 
obviously,
 
in
 
our
 
case.
 
The
 
same
 
thing
 
for
 
Infineon.
 
That
 
market
 
already
 
has
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
suppliers,
 
InnoScience
 
and
 
EPC,
 
they
 
actually
 
follow
 
a
 
different
 
common
 
spec
 
and
 
footprint
 
but
 
are
 
embroiled
 
in
 
a
 
patent
 
lawsuit
 
that
 
concerns
 
customers
 
and
 
causes
 
hesitation.
 
So
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
avoid
 
that
 
situation
 
to
 
give
 
them
 
the
 
risk
 
assurance,
 
supply
 
chain
 
risk
 
reduction,
 
assurance
 
of
 
2
 
strong
 
suppliers,
 
and
 
also
 
know
 
they're
 
free
 
of
 
any
 
patent
 
issues
 
to
 
worry
 
about.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
And
 
maybe
 
just
 
to
 
almost
 
counter
 
that,
 
but
 
is
 
there
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
product
 
differentiation
 
for
 
you
 
in
 
some
 
other
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
design,
 
maybe
 
it
 
support
 
or
 
just
 
any
 
other
 
angle
 
you
 
might
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
advantage
 
in
 
the
 
market?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
definitely.
 
Obviously,
 
we
 
differentiate
 
a
 
lot
 
on
 
our
 
system
 
design
 
and
 
technical
 
support.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
data
 
center
 
system
 
design
 
group
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
expanding
 
into
 
this
 
DC-to-DC
 
space,
 
giving
 
us
 
strong
 
technical
 
support,
 
close
 
collaboration,
 
maybe
 
in
 
joint
 
labs
 
with
 
customers.
 
But
 
also,
 
I
 
should
 
say
 
that
 
while
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
broad-based
 
GaN
 
cross-license,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
mean
 
we're
 
transferring
 
the
 
know-how.
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
something
 
where
 
we
 
can
 
choose
 
selectively
 
where
 
does
 
the
 
dual
 
sourcing
 
actually
 
benefits
 
customers
 
and
 
benefits
 
both
 
companies.
 
But
 
there'll
 
be
 
plenty
 
of
 
spaces
 
where
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
drive
 
differentiation
 
and
 
offer
 
sole-source
 
benchmark
 
solutions.
 
So
 
we'll
 
kind
 
of
 
pick
 
and
 
choose
 
where
 
that
 
dual-sourcing
 
relationship
 
makes
 
sense.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
And
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
I
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
congratulations
 
to
 
Todd
 
for
 
taking
 
the
 
position
 
as
 
CFO.
 
Looking
 
forward
 
to
 
working
 
with
 
you.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
is
 
from
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
from
 
Needham
 
&
 
Company.
 
Shadi
 
Mitwalli
 
This
 
is
 
Shadi
 
Mitwalli
 
dialing
 
in
 
for
 
Quinn
 
Bolton.
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
start
 
off
 
on
 
the
 
gross
 
margin
 
guide.
 
It
 
looks
 
like
 
you
 
guys
 
are
 
guiding
 
gross
 
margins
 
flat
 
even
 
though
 
revenue
 
will
 
be
 
down
 
a
 
few
 
million.
 
Is
 
this
 
due
 
to
 
mix?
 
Or
 
is
 
there
 
anything
 
else
 
contributing
 
to
 
the
 
gross
 
margin
 
guide?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
that's
 
a
 
great
 
question.
 
As
 
revenue
 
has
 
gone
 
down
 
a
 
little
 
bit,
 
mobile
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
strong.
 
And
 
within
 
mobile,
 
we've
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
expand
 
our
 
margins
 
with
 
that
 
product.
 
And
 
so
 
that's
 
why
 
we
 
were
 
able
 
to
 
keep
 
margins
 
flat
 
even
 
though
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
higher
 
power
 
markets
 
have
 
been
 
more
 
muted
 
on
 
the
 
revenue
 
growth.
 
Shadi
 
Mitwalli
 
And
 
then
 
my
 
follow-up
 
is
 
on
 
what
 
Navitas
 
is
 
seeing
 
in
 
the
 
automotive
 
market.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
auto
 
semi-players
 
have
 
talked
 
about
 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses
 
in
 
certain
 
geographies.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
curious
 
if
 
Navitas
 
is
 
seeing
 
the
 
same.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
We're
 
certainly
 
seeing
 
some
 
pickup
 
that's
 
encouraging.
 
I
 
think
 
a
 
year
 
ago
 
when
 
the
 
slowdown
 
started,
 
we
 
saw
 
a
 
pickup
 
with
 
hybrids.
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
continuing.
 
But
 
now
 
I
 
think
 
we're
 
seeing
 
a
 
pickup
 
with
 
pure
 
EV.
 
We're
 
mainly
 
engaged
 
on
 
the
 
OBC.
 
We
 
see
 
some
 
nice
 
progress
 
in
 
design
 
wins.
 
We
 
talked
 
about
 
6
 
new
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
Q3.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
momentum
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
continue,
 
not
 
just
 
OBC
 
roadside
 
chargers.
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
infrastructure
 
is
 
a
 
little
 
weak
 
and
 
building
 
out
 
slowly,
 
but
 
it's
 
got
 
to
 
accelerate
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
full
 
potential
 
for
 
battery
 
EV.
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
really
 
impressive
 
designs
 
going
 
on
 
roadside
 
chargers
 
with
 
our
 
high-voltage
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
That
 
will,
 
I
 
think,
 
be
 
really
 
instrumental
 
to
 
improving
 
the
 
speed
 
at
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
charged
 
up
 
with
 
your
 
car,
 
the
 
reliability
 
of
 
these
 
chargers,
 
and
 
of
 
course,
 
the
 
frequency
 
of
 
getting
 
more
 
of
 
them
 
spread
 
around.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
all
 
pretty
 
encouraging,
 
but
 
it
 
does
 
take
 
time
 
to
 
work
 
through
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
short-term
 
slower
 
growth
 
rates
 
everybody
 
is
 
experiencing
 
on
 
EV.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Tristan
 
Gerra
 
with
 
Baird.
 
Unknown
 
Analyst
 
This
 
is
 
Tyler
 
on
 
for
 
Tristan.
 
Where
 
are
 
channel
 
inventories
 
today
 
for
 
silicon
 
carbide?
 
And
 
then
 
maybe
 
initially,
 
how
 
are
 
you
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
market
 
growth
 
for
 
next
 
year?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Tyler.
 
Yes,
 
certainly,
 
with
 
the
 
slowdown
 
first
 
last
 
year
 
in
 
solar,
 
earlier
 
this
 
year,
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
it
 
with
 
industrial
 
and
 
EV.
 
Anytime
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
change
 
in
 
growth
 
rates,
 
we
 
do
 
see
 
pockets
 
of
 
channel
 
inventory.
 
It's
 
not
 
broad-based,
 
but
 
certainly,
 
there
 
are
 
some
 
pockets
 
that
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
worked
 
through.
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
channel
 
inventory
 
numbers
 
are
 
coming
 
down.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
trend
 
is
 
good.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
they're
 
all
 
factored
 
into
 
the
 
more
 
muted
 
outlook
 
for
 
Q4
 
and
 
Q1
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
our
 
bullishness
 
on
 
returning
 
to
 
strong
 
growth
 
next
 
year.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
growth
 
come
 
as
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
market
 
is
 
recovering.
 
We're
 
winning,
 
as
 
I
 
said,
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
designs
 
in
 
onboard
 
chargers,
 
off-board
 
chargers
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
industrial
 
and
 
solar.
 
We
 
talked
 
about
 
in
 
my
 
prepared
 
remarks,
 
10
 
new
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
solar,
 
that's
 
the
 
biggest
 
we've
 
seen
 
this
 
year.
 
So
 
these
 
are
 
good
 
encouraging
 
signs.
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
those
 
high-power
 
markets
 
are
 
silicon
 
carbide,
 
as
 
you
 
know.
 
And
 
then
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
layer
 
in
 
GaN
 
for
 
solar,
 
middle
 
of
 
next
 
year,
 
GaN
 
for
 
EV
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
end
 
of
 
next
 
year.
 
And
 
so
 
those
 
are
 
all
 
going
 
to
 
add
 
together
 
to
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
better
 
outlook
 
for
 
next
 
year.
 
Unknown
 
Analyst
 
Yes.
 
Great.
 
And
 
that
 
kind
 
of
 
touches
 
on
 
my
 
next
 
question.
 
We're
 
beginning
 
to
 
hear
 
some
 
higher
 
voltage
 
GaN
 
and
 
encroaching
 
on
 
traditional
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
applications.
 
What
 
are
 
your
 
views
 
on
 
this
 
development?
 
And
 
how
 
would
 
this
 
affect
 
Navitas
 
as
 
a
 
supplier
 
of
 
both
 
technologies?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Yes,
 
it's
 
definitely
 
an
 
interesting
 
space.
 
There's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
alternate
 
ways
 
to
 
go
 
about
 
it.
 
There's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
trade-offs,
 
too.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
there
 
today.
 
You
 
could
 
go
 
out
 
and
 
announce
 
a
 
1,200-volt
 
GaN
 
or
 
something
 
higher,
 
but
 
one
 
is
 
what's
 
the
 
reliability,
 
what's
 
the
 
performance,
 
but
 
also
 
what's
 
the
 
cost
 
effectiveness.
 
If
 
you
 
just
 
do
 
it
 
by
 
making
 
the
 
chip
 
a
 
lot
 
bigger
 
to
 
handle
 
that
 
voltage,
 
it
 
will
 
look
 
good.
 
The
 
specs
 
might
 
look
 
good,
 
but
 
it
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
cost
 
effective.
 
So
 
we're
 
really
 
taking
 
our
 
time
 
to
 
study
 
the
 
right
 
path,
 
what's
 
the
 
right
 
substrate,
 
what's
 
the
 
right
 
device
 
geometry,
 
what's
 
the
 
right
 
voltage
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
when
 
we
 
launch
 
that
 
higher
 
voltage
 
GaN,
 
we
 
really
 
nail
 
the
 
right
 
combination
 
of
 
commercial
 
and
 
technical
 
competitiveness.
 
So
 
I
 
do
 
think
 
high-voltage
 
GaN
 
as
 
basically
 
a
 
displacement
 
of
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technology
 
over
 
time
 
could
 
make
 
sense.
 
I
 
haven't
 
seen
 
anything
 
announced
 
now
 
that
 
I
 
think
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
significant
 
impact.
 
But
 
I
 
do
 
believe
 
when
 
Navitas
 
approaches
 
it,
 
we'll
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
approach
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
years.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
quick
 
solution.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Joe
 
Moore
 
with
 
Morgan
 
Stanley.
 
Joseph
 
Moore
 
I
 
wonder
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
restructuring
 
that
 
you're
 
doing,
 
anything
 
--
 
any
 
end
 
markets
 
that
 
you're
 
pulling
 
away
 
from
 
or
 
sort
 
of
 
what's
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
losing
 
the
 
headcount
 
that
 
you're
 
losing?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Joe.
 
As
 
Todd
 
described,
 
about
 
14%
 
headcount
 
in
 
aggregate,
 
about
 
$2
 
million
 
of
 
savings
 
per
 
quarter,
 
it
 
will
 
take
 
2
 
or
 
3
 
quarters
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
fully
 
realize
 
that.
 
Going
 
forward,
 
the
 
restructuring
 
and
 
headcount
 
reduction
 
was
 
reasonably
 
broad-based.
 
We
 
were
 
in
 
pretty
 
good
 
balance
 
so
 
there
 
wasn't
 
one
 
major
 
area
 
from
 
a
 
geographic
 
or
 
functional
 
impact.
 
But
 
not
 
just
 
in
 
cutting
 
--
 
tightening
 
the
 
belt
 
and
 
cutting
 
the
 
burn
 
rate
 
or
 
headcount,
 
but
 
also
 
in
 
sharpening
 
our
 
focus.
 
Todd
 
and
 
I
 
both
 
mentioned
 
mobile,
 
EV
 
and
 
AI
 
data
 
centers,
 
we're
 
sort
 
of
 
elevating
 
those.
 
So
 
in
 
some
 
cases,
 
we're
 
promoting
 
and
 
increasing
 
--
 
promoting
 
people
 
and
 
increasing
 
resources
 
around
 
those
 
3
 
areas.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
by
 
sharpening
 
our
 
focus
 
while
 
reducing
 
our
 
burn
 
rate,
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
we'll
 
have
 
a
 
financial
 
impact
 
on
 
growth
 
rate.
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
will
 
actually
 
accelerate
 
growth
 
rate
 
and
 
certainly
 
accelerate
 
our
 
time
 
to
 
profitability
 
and
 
the
 
revenue
 
threshold
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
to,
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 
So
 
mobile
 
and
 
EV
 
and
 
AI
 
data
 
centers
 
are
 
the
 
bigger
 
focus.
 
With
 
that
 
said,
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
already
 
proven
 
--
 
we
 
saw
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
mobile
 
world,
 
the
 
mobile
 
technology
 
we
 
developed,
 
the
 
[
 
Hridge
 
]
 
IC
 
found
 
really
 
good
 
homes
 
into
 
the
 
broader-based
 
appliance
 
market.
 
And
 
so
 
that
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
nice
 
adjacent
 
or
 
secondary
 
market
 
for
 
us.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
The
 
technologies
 
we
 
develop
 
for
 
mobile,
 
EV
 
and
 
AI
 
data
 
center
 
will
 
have
 
high
 
reuse
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
secondary
 
or
 
adjacent
 
markets,
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
consumer,
 
solar,
 
energy
 
storage
 
and
 
industrial.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
they'll
 
all
 
play
 
together,
 
and
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
update
 
you
 
and
 
talk
 
about
 
growth
 
and
 
design
 
wins
 
and
 
pipeline
 
in
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
segments.
 
Joseph
 
Moore
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
for
 
a
 
follow-up,
 
I'm
 
just
 
curious
 
about
 
pricing
 
for
 
new
 
sockets
 
right
 
now.
 
You've
 
got
 
European
 
competitors
 
with
 
empty
 
fabs,
 
Chinese
 
competitors
 
with
 
empty
 
fabs.
 
Do
 
you
 
see
 
that
 
having
 
an
 
impact
 
on
 
like-for-like
 
pricing
 
for
 
new
 
design
 
wins?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
definitely,
 
when
 
the
 
market
 
softens,
 
everybody
 
gets
 
a
 
little
 
more
 
aggressive
 
on
 
price
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
volumes
 
going,
 
keep
 
the
 
fabs
 
full.
 
The
 
flip
 
side
 
of
 
that
 
is
 
we've
 
had
 
tremendous
 
success
 
at
 
renegotiating
 
cost
 
structures,
 
both
 
on
 
the
 
GaN
 
side
 
and
 
the
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
side.
 
That's
 
at
 
the
 
starting
 
material
 
level,
 
epi
 
fab
 
and
 
device
 
level
 
packaging
 
and
 
assembly
 
and
 
test.
 
So
 
we
 
didn't
 
cite
 
any
 
numbers,
 
but
 
we're
 
really
 
taking
 
advantage
 
of
 
the
 
weaker
 
market
 
with
 
significantly
 
improved
 
cost
 
structures,
 
which
 
then
 
gives
 
us
 
ability
 
to
 
keep
 
pace
 
with
 
the
 
price
 
reductions
 
to
 
have
 
more
 
purchasing
 
leverage
 
and
 
even
 
win
 
business
 
with
 
incremental
 
gross
 
margins
 
as
 
things
 
improve,
 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
higher
 
power,
 
more
 
industrial
 
markets.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
how
 
we
 
see
 
it
 
playing
 
out.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
from
 
Charter
 
Equity
 
Research.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
So
 
for
 
the
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
and
 
the
 
48-volt
 
data
 
center
 
platform,
 
I
 
believe
 
the
 
market
 
there
 
for
 
like
 
intermediate
 
bus
 
converters
 
is
 
still
 
predominantly
 
silicon.
 
So
 
is
 
GaN
 
making
 
inroads
 
there
 
at
 
your
 
customers?
 
I
 
mean
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
--
 
GaN
 
has
 
very
 
good
 
efficiency,
 
but
 
silicon
 
is
 
such
 
so
 
cost
 
effective
 
that
 
it's
 
pretty
 
tough
 
to
 
compete
 
with.
 
So
 
are
 
more
 
data
 
center
 
customers
 
really
 
getting
 
real
 
about
 
using
 
GaN
 
in
 
those
 
intermediate
 
bus
 
converters?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
that's
 
a
 
really
 
good
 
summary,
 
Jack,
 
of
 
the
 
situation,
 
and
 
that's
 
kind
 
of
 
why
 
we
 
like
 
our
 
chances.
 
I
 
think
 
if
 
we
 
were
 
entering
 
late
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
had
 
already
 
taken
 
off
 
on
 
GaN,
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
problematic.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
there's
 
been
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
work
 
done,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
R&D,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
advanced
 
research,
 
some
 
products
 
going
 
into
 
production,
 
but
 
we
 
see
 
a
 
tremendous
 
potential
 
to
 
push
 
the
 
frequency
 
and
 
efficiency
 
up
 
with
 
our
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
as
 
we
 
did
 
with
 
mobile
 
chargers
 
and
 
really
 
cross
 
that
 
barrier
 
to
 
showing
 
significant
 
value
 
props
 
compared
 
to
 
silicon.
 
Also
 
combine
 
that
 
with
 
system
 
design,
 
it's
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
transistor.
 
Just
 
like
 
in
 
the
 
mobile
 
chargers,
 
we
 
brought
 
magnetic
 
capability.
 
[Par]
 
magnetics
 
will
 
be
 
really
 
critical
 
in
 
these
 
48-volt
 
DC
 
to
 
DC
 
converters,
 
pushing
 
the
 
frequencies
 
up
 
from
 
their
 
traditional
 
silicon
 
levels
 
in
 
hundreds
 
of
 
kilohertz
 
to
 
may
 
be
 
megahertz,
 
pushing
 
that
 
to
 
2
 
megahertz,
 
3
 
megahertz
 
and
 
higher.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
got
 
the
 
skills.
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
got
 
the
 
road
 
map.
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
got
 
the
 
technology
 
that
 
can
 
really
 
move
 
it.
 
Then
 
you
 
combine
 
that
 
with
 
2
 
strong
 
suppliers
 
with
 
Navitas,
 
Infineon,
 
some
 
common
 
specs
 
and
 
footprints
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
supply
 
chain
 
risks
 
or
 
any
 
IP
 
risks.
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
a
 
powerful
 
combination
 
that
 
will
 
really
 
show
 
up
 
at
 
the
 
right
 
time
 
and
 
the
 
right
 
place
 
as
 
we're
 
going
 
from
 
Blackwell
 
to
 
Blackwell
 
Ultra
 
to
 
Ruben,
 
there's
 
some
 
really
 
big
 
power
 
challenges
 
on
 
the
 
horizon,
 
and
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
work
 
in
 
solving
 
those.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
Great.
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
helpful.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
guess
 
a
 
good
 
segue
 
into
 
my
 
next
 
question
 
then.
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
curious
 
about
 
your
 
general
 
thoughts
 
on
 
liquid
 
cooling
 
in
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
kind
 
of
 
impacts
 
power
 
content.
 
I
 
think
 
there
 
are
 
arguments
 
for
 
both
 
sides
 
that
 
liquid
 
cooling
 
might
 
reduce
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
more
 
efficient
 
power
 
convergent
 
semiconductors.
 
But
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
the
 
processor
 
companies
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
that
 
liquid
 
cooling
 
to
 
just
 
keep
 
pushing
 
to
 
higher
 
and
 
higher
 
power
 
levels.
 
So
 
as
 
it
 
relates
 
to
 
power
 
content,
 
kind
 
of
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
liquid
 
cooling?
 
Is
 
it
 
a
 
benefit
 
for
 
power
 
semi
 
companies
 
or
 
could
 
it
 
be
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
a
 
headwind?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
nailed
 
it
 
with
 
your
 
latter
 
comments.
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
like
 
any
 
budget,
 
we
 
desperately
 
need.
 
As
 
an
 
industry,
 
we
 
desperately
 
need
 
a
 
bigger
 
power
 
budget.
 
If
 
you
 
don't
 
go
 
to
 
liquid
 
cooling,
 
everybody
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
limited
 
in
 
power,
 
including
 
the
 
processors.
 
And
 
then
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
stuck
 
and
 
then
 
you're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
keep
 
going
 
down
 
this
 
exciting
 
path
 
of
 
AI
 
processors
 
and
 
capabilities.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
liquid
 
cooling
 
is
 
inevitable.
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
necessary,
 
and
 
it
 
just
 
accelerates
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
the
 
whole
 
industry
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
full
 
potential
 
of
 
AI,
 
and
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
keep
 
that
 
parallel
 
going
 
up
 
and
 
up
 
and
 
up.
 
And
 
the
 
thirst
 
for
 
power
 
for
 
energy
 
savings
 
and
 
power
 
density
 
are
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
slow
 
down
 
with
 
liquid
 
cooling.
 
We
 
need
 
it
 
to
 
keep
 
going.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Jon
 
Tanwanteng
 
from
 
CJS
 
Securities.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
Gene,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
clarify,
 
will
 
Infineon
 
be
 
manufacturing
 
power
 
technologies
 
using
 
your
 
IP?
 
And
 
if
 
so,
 
how
 
does
 
that
 
benefit
 
you?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
We
 
--
 
well,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
the
 
benefit.
 
So
 
the
 
biggest
 
benefit,
 
as
 
I
 
said,
 
is
 
people
 
love
 
the
 
Navitas
 
GaN
 
technology,
 
love
 
GaN
 
ICs,
 
but
 
would
 
love
 
to
 
see
 
2
 
sources
 
for
 
this
 
advanced
 
GaN
 
technology.
 
It
 
really
 
allows
 
the
 
customer
 
to
 
go
 
much
 
faster
 
from
 
sort
 
of
 
their
 
initial
 
niche
 
adoption
 
or
 
first
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
kind
 
of
 
high-performance
 
platforms
 
into
 
the
 
high-volume
 
mainstream
 
adoption.
 
That's
 
where
 
they
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
2
 
sources,
 
2
 
credible
 
sources.
 
And
 
so
 
we're
 
bringing
 
them
 
now
 
2
 
credible
 
sources,
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
fixed
 
focus
 
areas,
 
which
 
starts
 
with
 
the
 
low-voltage
 
48-volt
 
GaN.
 
With
 
that
 
said,
 
our
 
technologies
 
are
 
developed
 
separately.
 
And
 
the
 
beauty
 
of
 
it
 
is
 
with
 
the
 
cross
 
licensing,
 
we
 
can
 
develop
 
these
 
products,
 
common
 
specs,
 
common
 
footprints,
 
common
 
sourcing
 
for
 
the
 
customer,
 
dual
 
sourcing
 
for
 
the
 
customer,
 
but
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
worry
 
about
 
patent
 
infringement
 
between
 
the
 
2
 
companies.
 
That's
 
the
 
simplest
 
way
 
to
 
describe
 
it
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
benefit
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
will
 
work.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
Got
 
it.
 
So
 
it's
 
only
 
a
 
form
 
factor
 
that's
 
shared
 
as
 
a
 
partnership,
 
if
 
that
 
makes
 
sense?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
You
 
mentioned
 
returning
 
to
 
strong
 
growth
 
versus
 
near-term
 
headwinds.
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
if
 
you
 
expect
 
growth
 
to
 
remain
 
negative
 
heading
 
into
 
Q1?
 
And
 
if
 
so,
 
when
 
does
 
the
 
inflection
 
occur
 
as
 
we
 
get
 
into
 
next
 
year?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
know
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
debate
 
and
 
various
 
opinions
 
next
 
year.
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
general
 
consensus
 
is
 
we'll
 
see
 
decent
 
market
 
recovery
 
throughout
 
next
 
year.
 
We
 
certainly
 
feel
 
bullish
 
about
 
all
 
the
 
design
 
wins,
 
the
 
design
 
win
 
momentum
 
we've
 
had
 
for
 
the
 
last
 
2
 
or
 
3
 
quarters,
 
the
 
pipeline
 
conversion
 
that
 
we're
 
seeing.
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
those
 
kicking
 
in
 
as
 
Q2
 
and
 
Q3,
 
next
 
year.
 
The
 
2
 
projects
 
that
 
pushed
 
out
 
from
 
Q4,
 
one
 
is
 
an
 
EV
 
one,
 
another
 
one
 
is
 
an
 
industrial
 
one.
 
Those
 
are
 
both
 
two-
 
to
 
three-quarter
 
push
 
outs.
 
So
 
instead
 
of
 
seeing
 
multimillion
 
dollar
 
impacts
 
in
 
Q4,
 
those
 
are
 
pushed
 
to
 
Q2
 
or
 
Q3.
 
So
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
things
 
point
 
to
 
that
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
With
 
that
 
said,
 
Q1
 
is
 
seasonally
 
typically
 
down.
 
Last
 
year
 
was
 
down
 
11%.
 
We
 
see
 
that
 
seasonality
 
continuing
 
or
 
even
 
getting
 
magnified.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
mentioned
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
quarters.
 
We're
 
not
 
formally
 
guiding
 
to
 
Q1,
 
but
 
its
 
clear
 
Q1
 
looks
 
seasonally
 
down
 
and
 
a
 
bit
 
soft.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
would
 
expect
 
we're
 
on
 
to
 
a
 
strong
 
recovery
 
in
 
growth
 
thereafter.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
And
 
then
 
lastly,
 
I
 
didn't
 
hear
 
you
 
mention
 
the
 
industrial
 
and
 
appliances
 
business,
 
specifically
 
the
 
appliances.
 
I'm
 
wondering
 
how
 
that
 
fits
 
into
 
the
 
new
 
equation
 
where
 
you're
 
focusing
 
on
 
EV
 
and
 
data
 
center
 
and
 
mobile?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
It
 
will
 
continue.
 
And
 
I
 
did
 
mention,
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
short
 
comment,
 
admittedly,
 
appliance
 
and
 
industrial
 
with
 
25
 
more
 
design
 
wins,
 
which
 
is
 
great.
 
It's
 
got
 
a
 
nice
 
long
 
tail.
 
They're
 
not
 
usually
 
as
 
big
 
as
 
we
 
know,
 
right,
 
not
 
$5
 
million
 
or
 
$10
 
million
 
programs,
 
but
 
a
 
nice
 
long
 
tail
 
of
 
small-
 
to
 
medium-sized
 
customers.
 
25
 
design
 
wins
 
that's
 
usually
 
GaN
 
in
 
appliance,
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
and
 
industrial.
 
That's
 
nice.
 
We
 
had
 
--
 
or
 
sorry,
 
it
 
was
 
30
 
in
 
Q3.
 
We
 
had
 
25
 
in
 
Q2.
 
So
 
that's
 
good.
 
And
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned
 
earlier,
 
even
 
as
 
we
 
increase
 
focus
 
on
 
mobile,
 
EV
 
and
 
AI
 
data
 
centers,
 
the
 
technology
 
we
 
develop
 
for
 
those
 
markets
 
will
 
have
 
high
 
reuse
 
into
 
appliance,
 
industrial,
 
solar,
 
energy
 
storage
 
and
 
consumer.
 
So
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
track
 
and
 
drive
 
those,
 
but
 
with
 
greater
 
emphasis
 
on
 
our
 
biggest
 
drivers,
 
mobile
 
EV
 
and
 
AI
 
data
 
center.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
from
 
Rosenblatt.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
Thanks
 
for
 
taking
 
my
 
follow-up.
 
Last
 
week,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
smartphone
 
supplier
 
that
 
said
 
that
 
there's
 
a
 
trend
 
in
 
smartphones
 
where
 
they're
 
shifting
 
from
 
mid-range
 
phones
 
to
 
entry-level
 
phones.
 
First,
 
are
 
you
 
seeing
 
that?
 
They're
 
kind
 
of
 
saying
 
it's
 
a
 
barbell
 
now
 
of
 
high-end
 
phones
 
or
 
entry-level
 
phones?
 
Are
 
you
 
seeing
 
that?
 
And
 
does
 
that
 
change
 
anything
 
in
 
your
 
market?
 
I
 
think
 
a
 
little
 
bit.
 
What
 
matters
 
to
 
us,
 
of
 
course,
 
entry-level
 
can
 
mean
 
maybe
 
more
 
volume
 
because
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
hit
 
better
 
price
 
points.
 
Of
 
course,
 
the
 
key
 
for
 
us
 
is
 
what's
 
the
 
charging
 
power.
 
They're
 
going
 
to
 
keep
 
charging
 
super
 
slow
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
minimize
 
the
 
cost,
 
but
 
not
 
maximize
 
the
 
consumer
 
experience,
 
20
 
watts,
 
15
 
watt
 
chargers,
 
then
 
that's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
interesting
 
to
 
us,
 
as
 
you
 
know.
 
But
 
what
 
we're
 
seeing
 
is
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
guys
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
mainstream
 
chargers
 
and
 
even
 
you
 
might
 
call
 
them
 
entry-level
 
chargers,
 
but
 
pushing
 
that
 
power
 
level
 
to
 
45
 
watts
 
or
 
higher.
 
As
 
we've
 
always
 
talked
 
about,
 
that's
 
really
 
the
 
tipping
 
point
 
for
 
GaN
 
bringing
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
value,
 
bring
 
a
 
much
 
faster
 
charging
 
experience.
 
So
 
as
 
one
 
--
 
so
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
exactly
 
of
 
that
 
announcement.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
the
 
specifics
 
and
 
don't
 
know
 
the
 
charging.
 
But
 
as
 
one
 
relevant
 
point,
 
I
 
didn't
 
highlight
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
prepared
 
remarks,
 
but
 
we're
 
doing
 
great
 
work
 
with
 
transient.
 
And
 
you
 
may
 
not
 
--
 
that's
 
not
 
a
 
household
 
name
 
for
 
smartphones,
 
but
 
they're
 
the
 
leaders
 
in
 
Africa
 
and
 
other
 
third
 
world
 
regions.
 
And
 
we're
 
making
 
incredible
 
progress
 
in
 
bringing
 
cost-effective
 
45
 
watt,
 
65
 
watt
 
chargers
 
to
 
those
 
really
 
low-cost
 
phones.
 
So
 
that's
 
been
 
a
 
pleasant
 
surprise
 
for
 
us.
 
It's
 
adding
 
to
 
our
 
numbers.
 
We
 
said
 
GaN
 
was
 
at
 
a
 
mobile
 
charger
 
all-time
 
high
 
in
 
Q3.
 
They're
 
part
 
of
 
that
 
mix
 
already.
 
So
 
that's
 
one
 
relevant
 
customer
 
example
 
that
 
shows
 
me
 
we
 
can
 
bring
 
fast
 
charging
 
and
 
GaN
 
fast
 
charging
 
even
 
into
 
sort
 
of
 
entry-level
 
and
 
mainstream
 
phones
 
or,
 
let's
 
say,
 
super
 
price-sensitive
 
phones.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
from
 
Craig-Hallum
 
Capital
 
Group.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
I
 
apologize
 
for
 
jumping
 
late
 
on
 
here
 
and
 
asking
 
a
 
question
 
that
 
I'm
 
sure
 
has
 
been
 
discussed
 
before,
 
but
 
let
 
me
 
ask
 
a
 
simple
 
one,
 
just
 
reading
 
from
 
the
 
press
 
release
 
here
 
with
 
a
 
kind
 
of
 
refocusing
 
on
 
certain
 
markets
 
that
 
don't
 
include
 
solar
 
here.
 
So
 
I'm
 
kind
 
of
 
curious
 
what
 
we're
 
thinking
 
about
 
that
 
space.
 
Is
 
this
 
an
 
area
 
of
 
continued
 
development
 
at
 
all?
 
Or
 
just
 
--
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
your
 
read
 
on
 
this
 
from
 
that
 
team,
 
please.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
definitely.
 
I
 
think
 
if
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
broad-based
 
solar,
 
it's
 
a
 
decent-sized
 
market.
 
But
 
given
 
where
 
we're
 
at
 
as
 
a
 
smaller
 
company,
 
our
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
being
 
a
 
smaller
 
business,
 
focus
 
is
 
pretty
 
key.
 
And
 
so
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
capture
 
and
 
win,
 
I
 
think
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
and
 
broad-based
 
solar
 
applications
 
with
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
If
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
strategically
 
where
 
can
 
Navitas
 
bring
 
the
 
most
 
value,
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
is
 
super
 
exciting,
 
where
 
we
 
can
 
bring
 
our
 
system
 
design
 
centers
 
to
 
bear.
 
And
 
we've
 
got
 
one
 
in
 
EV.
 
We've
 
got
 
one
 
in
 
data
 
centers.
 
We've
 
got
 
one
 
in
 
mobile.
 
So
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
technologies
 
we
 
can
 
uniquely
 
bring
 
the
 
deep
 
system
 
knowledge
 
and
 
system
 
focus
 
around
 
mobile,
 
EV
 
and
 
data
 
center,
 
that's
 
where
 
we'll
 
place
 
our
 
biggest
 
bets.
 
That
 
doesn't
 
mean
 
there
 
aren't
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
opportunities.
 
And
 
even
 
niche.
 
So
 
even
 
within
 
the
 
world
 
of
 
solar,
 
I
 
commented
 
on
 
silicon
 
carbide,
 
GaN
 
is
 
emerging
 
really
 
promising
 
opportunity
 
for
 
solar
 
microinverters
 
in
 
particular,
 
not
 
broad-based
 
solar.
 
So
 
even
 
there,
 
we'll
 
find
 
our
 
niches,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
sizable
 
niches,
 
and
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
those
 
areas.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
bidirectional
 
GaN
 
as
 
an
 
example,
 
into
 
solar
 
microinverters,
 
I
 
reiterated
 
in
 
my
 
prepared
 
remarks,
 
is
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
a
 
nice
 
ramp-up
 
in
 
mid-'25.
 
So
 
this
 
focus
 
on
 
mobile,
 
EV
 
and
 
data
 
centers
 
will
 
be
 
very
 
important,
 
very
 
strategic,
 
but
 
it
 
won't
 
be
 
exclusive
 
and
 
ignoring
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
other
 
opportunities
 
in
 
the
 
other
 
markets.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
Okay.
 
Fair
 
enough.
 
And
 
maybe
 
just
 
a
 
quick
 
follow-up
 
here.
 
You
 
talked
 
about
 
a
 
dual
 
sourcing
 
arrangement
 
with
 
Infineon
 
for
 
lower
 
voltage
 
products
 
here.
 
Obviously,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
announcement
 
I've
 
seen
 
of
 
this.
 
I
 
think
 
you've
 
alluded
 
to
 
it
 
before.
 
I
 
am
 
honestly
 
not
 
familiar
 
with
 
whether
 
Infineon
 
has
 
announced
 
any
 
products
 
in
 
this
 
general
 
voltage
 
area
 
here.
 
So
 
maybe
 
you
 
can
 
just
 
discuss
 
how
 
this
 
partnership
 
came
 
up,
 
how
 
you
 
expect
 
it
 
to
 
ramp
 
out
 
here.
 
Generally,
 
when
 
do
 
you
 
expect
 
to
 
start
 
to
 
see
 
some
 
real
 
revenue
 
contributions
 
from
 
it?
 
Yes.
 
It's
 
certainly
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
works
 
for
 
months.
 
Obviously,
 
just
 
being
 
public
 
today
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time.
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
about
 
Infineon's
 
time
 
line
 
for
 
their
 
public
 
announcements,
 
but
 
they're
 
certainly
 
aware
 
of
 
what
 
we're
 
announcing
 
today,
 
and
 
I'm
 
sure
 
theirs
 
will
 
be
 
coming.
 
Coming
 
soon,
 
the
 
dual
 
sourcing
 
is
 
very
 
focused
 
on
 
this
 
particular
 
family
 
where
 
we
 
see
 
a
 
really
 
hot
 
opportunity
 
in
 
AI
 
data
 
centers
 
in
 
particular.
 
There's
 
a
 
real
 
need
 
for
 
it,
 
but
 
people
 
love
 
dual
 
sourcing,
 
especially
 
they
 
get
 
it
 
with
 
this
 
advanced
 
technology
 
to
 
solve
 
the
 
efficiency
 
and
 
density
 
problems
 
of
 
data
 
centers.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
sampling
 
the
 
first
 
low-voltage
 
GaN
 
actually
 
this
 
quarter,
 
so
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
weeks.
 
That's
 
coming
 
quite
 
quickly,
 
and
 
we
 
expect
 
first
 
production
 
ramps
 
late
 
next
 
year.

no
 
further
