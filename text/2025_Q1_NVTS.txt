CEO.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Thanks
 
to
 
all
 
of
 
you
 
for
 
joining
 
our
 
Q1
 
'25
 
earnings
 
call.
 
Our
 
Q1
 
2025
 
revenues
 
came
 
in
 
line
 
with
 
guidance
 
at
 
$14
 
million
 
and
 
38%
 
gross
 
margin.
 
While
 
the
 
slowdown
 
in
 
channel
 
inventory
 
in
 
EV,
 
solar
 
and
 
industrial
 
continues
 
to
 
present
 
some
 
near-term
 
headwinds
 
in
 
our
 
business,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
walk
 
through
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
important
 
recent
 
market
 
and
 
product
 
developments
 
that
 
I
 
expect
 
will
 
set
 
up
 
for
 
a
 
strong
 
2026
 
as
 
the
 
market
 
recovers
 
and
 
many
 
design
 
wins
 
kick
 
in
 
later
 
this
 
year.
 
In
 
Q1,
 
we
 
announced
 
the
 
industry's
 
first
 
production
 
release
 
of
 
a
 
bidirectional
 
GaN
 
IC.
 
As
 
we
 
described
 
in
 
our
 
online
 
launch
 
event
 
and
 
available
 
video,
 
GaN
 
bidirectional
 
switches
 
or
 
BDS,
 
is
 
a
 
revolutionary
 
new
 
technology
 
that
 
creates
 
an
 
ideal
 
switch
 
that
 
the
 
industry
 
has
 
never
 
seen
 
in
 
40-plus
 
years
 
of
 
power
 
semiconductor
 
development.
 
No
 
other
 
power
 
semi
 
device
 
in
 
the
 
industry's
 
history
 
across
 
silicon,
 
GaN,
 
or
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
has
 
achieved
 
this
 
ideal
 
combination
 
of
 
capabilities.
 
GaN
 
BDS
 
makes
 
it
 
technically
 
and
 
commercially
 
feasible
 
to
 
reduce
 
traditional
 
two-stage
 
converters
 
that
 
are
 
used
 
in
 
over
 
70%
 
of
 
power
 
electronics
 
into
 
one
 
single
 
stage
 
while
 
enabling
 
bidirectional
 
energy
 
flow.
 
GaN
 
BDS
 
eliminates
 
dozens
 
of
 
large
 
and
 
expensive
 
components
 
in
 
that
 
second
 
stage,
 
resulting
 
in
 
size,
 
weight,
 
cost,
 
and
 
power
 
loss
 
improvements
 
of
 
30%
 
or
 
more.
 
When
 
combined
 
with
 
our
 
new
 
IsoFast
 
family
 
of
 
high-frequency
 
isolated
 
drivers,
 
this
 
chipset
 
creates
 
new
 
opportunities
 
to
 
accelerate
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
with
 
the
 
single-stage
 
converters
 
into
 
EV
 
onboard
 
chargers,
 
solar
 
microinverters,
 
charging
 
and
 
discharging
 
of
 
energy
 
storage
 
systems,
 
motor
 
control
 
applications,
 
and
 
others.
 
The
 
first
 
customer
 
adopting
 
our
 
GaN
 
BDS
 
is
 
in
 
solar
 
microinverters
 
and
 
expects
 
to
 
ramp
 
later
 
this
 
year,
 
and
 
we
 
expect
 
others
 
to
 
ramp
 
throughout
 
2026
 
in
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
the
 
applications
 
mentioned.
 
In
 
addition,
 
we
 
announced
 
our
 
GaNSafe
 
technology
 
has
 
now
 
been
 
automotive
 
qualified
 
to
 
the
 
challenging
 
AEC
 
P101
 
standard,
 
and
 
our
 
GaNSafe
 
has
 
been
 
adopted
 
in
 
the
 
industry's
 
first
 
GaN
 
EV
 
onboard
 
charger
 
design
 
with
 
Changan
 
Auto,
 
a
 
top
 
EV
 
maker
 
in
 
China,
 
with
 
expected
 
production
 
in
 
early
 
'26.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
major
 
industry-first
 
achievement.
 
Additional
 
GaN
 
EV
 
wins
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
also
 
ramp
 
throughout
 
2026
 
as
 
Navitas
 
is
 
pioneering
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
into
 
an
 
entire
 
new
 
mainstream
 
market
 
of
 
electric
 
vehicles.
 
We
 
have
 
released
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
GaN
 
reliability
 
report,
 
which
 
not
 
only
 
highlights
 
this
 
major
 
Q101
 
automotive
 
qualification
 
achievement,
 
but
 
demonstrates
 
our
 
aggregate
 
field
 
reliability
 
track
 
record,
 
which
 
spans
 
seven
 
years
 
since
 
first
 
GaN
 
production
 
release
 
in
 
2018.
 
Over
 
this
 
time,
 
we've
 
advanced
 
the
 
technology
 
and
 
its
 
reliability
 
across
 
four
 
generations
 
and
 
continual
 
design
 
innovations
 
and
 
integrations
 
that
 
have
 
translated
 
into
 
an
 
aggregate
 
250
 
million
 
units
 
shipped
 
and
 
a
 
continuous
 
improvement
 
in
 
field
 
reliability
 
that
 
has
 
now
 
reached
 
an
 
unprecedented
 
100
 
parts
 
per
 
billion
 
failure
 
rate,
 
far
 
exceeding
 
any
 
industry
 
requirement.
 
In
 
a
 
similar
 
fashion,
 
we
 
have
 
spent
 
the
 
last
 
two
 
years
 
since
 
the
 
GeneSiC
 
acquisition,
 
improving
 
and
 
demonstrating
 
the
 
extraordinary
 
reliability
 
performance
 
of
 
our
 
GeneSiC
 
technology.
 
We
 
will
 
soon
 
be
 
announcing
 
a
 
new
 
reliability
 
standard
 
we
 
call
 
AEC
 
Plus,
 
which
 
exceeds
 
the
 
stringent
 
automotive
 
AEC
 
standards
 
by
 
100%
 
or
 
more
 
for
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
industry
 
standard
 
reliability
 
tests
 
and
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
our
 
testing
 
of
 
competitive
 
technologies.
 
When
 
we
 
combine
 
this
 
impressive
 
reliability
 
achievement
 
with
 
our
 
demonstrated
 
ultra-high-voltage
 
capability,
 
enabling
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
to
 
support
 
2.3
 
kV
 
and
 
up
 
to
 
6.5
 
kV,
 
we
 
are
 
pioneering
 
reliability
 
and
 
voltage
 
capabilities
 
essential
 
in
 
enabling
 
new
 
energy
 
markets
 
that
 
include
 
next-generation
 
megawatt
 
applications
 
spanning
 
EV
 
fast
 
chargers,
 
energy
 
storage,
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
and
 
grid
 
infrastructure
 
upgrades.
 
Stay
 
tuned
 
for
 
many
 
more
 
market
 
developments
 
and
 
customer
 
wins
 
on
 
this
 
front.
 
Also,
 
while
 
passenger
 
battery
 
electric
 
vehicles
 
have
 
seen
 
some
 
slowdown
 
in
 
inventory
 
corrections,
 
we're
 
excited
 
to
 
announce
 
adoption
 
of
 
our
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technology
 
with
 
two
 
significant
 
commercial
 
EV
 
customers.
 
While
 
the
 
commercial
 
EV
 
market,
 
which
 
includes
 
long-haul
 
trucks,
 
forklift,
 
mining,
 
and
 
other
 
commercial
 
applications,
 
is
 
a
 
smaller
 
market
 
compared
 
to
 
passenger
 
EVs,
 
it
 
requires
 
much
 
higher
 
power,
 
higher
 
voltage,
 
higher
 
reliability,
 
plus
 
higher
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
content,
 
a
 
perfect
 
fit
 
for
 
our
 
GeneSiC
 
technology.
 
We're
 
happy
 
to
 
announce
 
two
 
significant
 
wins
 
in
 
this
 
space,
 
which
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
enable
 
a
 
multimillion-dollar
 
impact
 
in
 
2026.
 
In
 
data
 
centers,
 
AI
 
continues
 
to
 
drive
 
a
 
dramatic
 
increase
 
in
 
total
 
power,
 
power
 
density,
 
and
 
power
 
efficiency.
 
Navitas
 
continues
 
our
 
significant
 
system
 
design
 
progress,
 
utilizing
 
our
 
latest
 
GeneSiC
 
and
 
GaNSafe
 
ICs,
 
including
 
new
 
Intelliweave
 
control
 
technology,
 
where
 
we
 
started
 
with
 
a
 
2.7
 
kilowatt
 
design
 
last
 
year
 
and
 
then
 
pushed
 
power
 
levels
 
in
 
new
 
system
 
designs
 
to
 
3.2
 
kilowatt,
 
4.5
 
kilowatt,
 
8.5
 
kilowatt,
 
and
 
today,
 
I'm
 
pleased
 
to
 
announce
 
a
 
new
 
12-kilowatt
 
design
 
that
 
we
 
will
 
formally
 
launch
 
at
 
Computex
 
later
 
this
 
month.
 
12-kilowatt
 
represents
 
an
 
industry
 
first
 
for
 
data
 
centers,
 
and
 
this
 
platform
 
is
 
only
 
possible
 
with
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technologies,
 
a
 
perfect
 
fit
 
for
 
our
 
pure-play
 
wideband
 
gap
 
capabilities.
 
While
 
most
 
initial
 
Blackwell-based
 
systems
 
are
 
utilizing
 
power
 
supply
 
designs
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
4.5
 
kilowatts,
 
this
 
12-kilowatt
 
platform
 
will
 
enable
 
Blackwell,
 
Blackwell
 
Ultra,
 
and
 
future
 
Rubin
 
platforms
 
to
 
more
 
than
 
double
 
the
 
total
 
rack
 
power
 
to
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
500
 
kilowatts.
 
We
 
already
 
have
 
over
 
75
 
customer
 
projects
 
in
 
production
 
or
 
development
 
using
 
either
 
silicon
 
carbide,
 
GaN,
 
or
 
both,
 
and
 
expect
 
this
 
pipeline
 
to
 
accelerate
 
with
 
this
 
12-kilowatt
 
launch.
 
Last
 
week,
 
we
 
announced
 
some
 
Board
 
and
 
executive
 
changes,
 
which
 
we
 
believe
 
will
 
accelerate
 
the
 
company's
 
transition
 
from
 
early
 
growth
 
stage
 
to
 
much
 
greater
 
scale
 
and
 
profitability.
 
To
 
enhance
 
our
 
governance,
 
we
 
have
 
separated
 
the
 
Chair
 
and
 
CEO
 
roles
 
and
 
announced
 
Rick
 
Hendrix
 
as
 
our
 
new
 
Independent
 
Chair.
 
Rick
 
has
 
been
 
on
 
the
 
Board
 
since
 
our
 
IPO
 
and
 
brings
 
significant
 
capital
 
markets
 
and
 
executive
 
leadership
 
skills
 
to
 
the
 
role.
 
We
 
also
 
announced
 
our
 
CTO,
 
COO,
 
Dan
 
Kinzer,
 
is
 
transitioning
 
into
 
a
 
technical
 
advisory
 
role
 
with
 
the
 
anticipation
 
of
 
a
 
new
 
incoming
 
COO
 
that
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
announce
 
in
 
the
 
near
 
future.
 
At
 
Navitas
 
and
 
throughout
 
my
 
career,
 
Dan
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
great
 
friend
 
and
 
business
 
partner
 
and
 
has
 
been
 
instrumental
 
in
 
the
 
creation
 
of
 
Navitas
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
10-plus
 
years.
 
While
 
his
 
executive
 
role
 
is
 
changing,
 
we
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
Dan's
 
world-class
 
innovation
 
contributions
 
going
 
forward
 
in
 
his
 
new
 
advisory
 
role.
 
Let
 
me
 
summarize
 
the
 
significant
 
market
 
and
 
technology
 
developments
 
that
 
I've
 
described
 
today.
 
Our
 
high-powered
 
GaN
 
ICs
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technologies
 
are
 
very
 
well
 
positioned
 
to
 
open
 
up
 
all
 
new
 
markets
 
for
 
Navitas
 
and
 
in
 
many
 
cases,
 
for
 
the
 
industry.
 
GaNSafe
 
and
 
GeneSiC
 
technologies
 
are
 
ramping
 
into
 
mainstream
 
AI
 
data
 
center
 
applications
 
throughout
 
this
 
year.
 
Hidirectional
 
GaN
 
is
 
a
 
game-changing
 
technology
 
that
 
we
 
expect
 
will
 
start
 
enabling
 
next-generation
 
solar
 
microinverters
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
this
 
year.
 
GaNSafe
 
is
 
now
 
auto-qualified
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
first
 
GaN
 
adopted
 
in
 
mainstream
 
EV
 
applications,
 
expected
 
to
 
begin
 
production
 
early
 
next
 
year.
 
GeneSiC
 
technology
 
is
 
now
 
qualified
 
to
 
far
 
exceed
 
these
 
automotive
 
reliability
 
standards
 
and
 
is
 
gaining
 
important
 
share
 
in
 
commercial
 
EV
 
applications.
 
Combined
 
with
 
our
 
ultra-high
 
voltage
 
capability
 
of
 
2.3
 
kV
 
or
 
higher,
 
GeneSiC
 
is
 
an
 
enabling
 
technology
 
for
 
a
 
broad
 
range
 
of
 
new
 
energy
 
megawatt
 
applications
 
that
 
are
 
critical
 
to
 
fulfill
 
our
 
mission
 
to
 
electrify
 
our
 
world.
 
Now
 
let
 
me
 
turn
 
it
 
over
 
to
 
Todd
 
to
 
discuss
 
our
 
financial
 
performance
 
and
 
outlook.
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Gene.
 
In
 
my
 
comments
 
today,
 
I
 
will
 
take
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
first
 
quarter
 
2025
 
financial
 
results,
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
outlook
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
quarter,
 
along
 
with
 
our
 
current
 
view
 
on
 
how
 
recent
 
market
 
and
 
tariff
 
dynamics
 
may
 
impact
 
our
 
business.
 
Revenue
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025
 
was
 
at
 
the
 
midpoint
 
of
 
guidance
 
at
 
$14
 
million.
 
As
 
expected,
 
the
 
sequential
 
decline
 
was
 
due
 
to
 
seasonality
 
and
 
soft
 
demand
 
with
 
associated
 
remaining
 
inventory
 
correction.
 
The
 
decline
 
compared
 
to
 
a
 
year
 
ago
 
quarter
 
was
 
primarily
 
the
 
result
 
of
 
lower
 
revenues
 
in
 
the
 
EV
 
and
 
solar
 
markets.
 
Before
 
addressing
 
gross
 
profit
 
and
 
expenses,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
you
 
to
 
the
 
GAAP
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
reconciliations
 
in
 
our
 
press
 
release
 
earlier
 
today.
 
In
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
my
 
commentary,
 
I
 
will
 
refer
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
measures.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
quarter
 
was
 
38.1%,
 
which
 
was
 
down
 
sequentially
 
compared
 
to
 
40.2%
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter,
 
primarily
 
due
 
to
 
less
 
favorable
 
market
 
mix.
 
In
 
the
 
first
 
quarter,
 
we
 
executed
 
on
 
further
 
synergies
 
and
 
operational
 
efficiencies
 
associated
 
with
 
prior
 
acquisitions,
 
and
 
we
 
reduced
 
operating
 
expenses
 
sequentially
 
to
 
$17.2
 
million,
 
which
 
is
 
ahead
 
of
 
scheduled
 
cost
 
reductions.
 
Operating
 
expenses
 
were
 
comprised
 
of
 
SG&A
 
expenses
 
of
 
$8.3
 
million
 
and
 
R&D
 
expenses
 
of
 
$8.8
 
million.
 
Consolidating
 
certain
 
support
 
and
 
engineering
 
functions
 
and
 
sites
 
and
 
further
 
streamlining
 
the
 
business
 
demonstrates
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
balance
 
operational
 
efficiency
 
while
 
we
 
continue
 
investing
 
in
 
next-generation
 
GaN
 
and
 
SiC
 
technology
 
and
 
in
 
market
 
developments,
 
primarily
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
center,
 
EV,
 
and
 
mobile
 
sectors.
 
Adding
 
all
 
this
 
together,
 
the
 
first
 
quarter
 
2025
 
loss
 
from
 
operations
 
improved
 
sequentially
 
to
 
$11.8
 
million
 
from
 
$12.7
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
2024,
 
with
 
cost
 
reductions
 
more
 
than
 
offsetting
 
quarter-over-quarter
 
revenue
 
decline.
 
Our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
quarter
 
was
 
188
 
million
 
shares.
 
Turning
 
to
 
the
 
balance
 
sheet.
 
Accounts
 
receivable
 
sequentially
 
declined
 
to
 
approximately
 
$12
 
million
 
from
 
$14
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
prior
 
quarter,
 
and
 
inventory
 
remained
 
relatively
 
flat
 
at
 
$16
 
million.
 
Our
 
balance
 
sheet
 
remains
 
very
 
strong
 
as
 
we
 
exit
 
Q1
 
2025
 
with
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
liquidity
 
and
 
an
 
improved
 
working
 
capital
 
position.
 
Cash
 
and
 
cash
 
equivalents
 
at
 
quarter
 
end
 
were
 
$75
 
million,
 
and
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
carry
 
no
 
debt.
 
Moving
 
on
 
to
 
guidance
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
quarter.
 
We
 
currently
 
expect
 
revenues
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
$14
 
million
 
to
 
$15
 
million,
 
reflecting
 
continued
 
softness
 
and
 
industry-wide
 
inventory
 
corrections
 
in
 
solar,
 
EV,
 
and
 
industrial
 
end
 
markets.
 
The
 
impact
 
of
 
tariffs
 
is
 
dynamic,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
continuing
 
to
 
monitor
 
the
 
latest
 
updates,
 
particularly
 
between
 
China
 
and
 
the
 
U.S.
 
While
 
SiC
 
represents
 
a
 
minority
 
of
 
our
 
total
 
revenue,
 
our
 
products
 
are
 
produced
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
at
 
X-FAB,
 
and
 
the
 
majority
 
is
 
sold
 
in
 
China.
 
Ultimately,
 
our
 
U.S.
 
SiC
 
manufacturing
 
location
 
will
 
provide
 
Navitas,
 
over
 
time,
 
with
 
a
 
significant
 
strategic
 
advantage
 
with
 
our
 
U.S.
 
customers
 
for
 
EV,
 
solar,
 
energy
 
storage,
 
and
 
grid
 
infrastructure.
 
We
 
anticipate
 
GaN
 
revenues,
 
which
 
represent
 
the
 
significant
 
majority
 
of
 
our
 
revenue
 
today
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
limited
 
direct
 
impact
 
from
 
tariffs
 
as
 
our
 
GaN
 
products
 
are
 
manufactured
 
in
 
Taiwan
 
and
 
are
 
sold
 
predominantly
 
outside
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Despite
 
the
 
tariff
 
risks
 
in
 
our
 
China
 
SiC
 
revenues
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
anticipate
 
growth
 
to
 
resume
 
towards
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
fueled
 
by
 
our
 
strong
 
design
 
wins
 
across
 
AI,
 
data
 
center,
 
solar,
 
EV
 
and
 
mobile
 
sectors.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
slightly
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
first
 
quarter,
 
with
 
our
 
guidance
 
at
 
38.5%,
 
plus
 
or
 
minus
 
50
 
basis
 
points,
 
as
 
our
 
expected
 
mix
 
continues
 
to
 
lean
 
toward
 
the
 
mobile
 
market
 
in
 
the
 
near
 
term.
 
Turning
 
to
 
operating
 
expenses.
 
We
 
anticipate
 
operating
 
expenses
 
of
 
$15.5
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter,
 
down
 
from
 
$17.2
 
million
 
in
 
Q1
 
2025
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
execute
 
on
 
our
 
plan
 
of
 
streamlining
 
the
 
business
 
across
 
mobile,
 
data
 
center,
 
and
 
EV
 
to
 
drive
 
the
 
business
 
to
 
EBITDA
 
breakeven.
 
For
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025,
 
we
 
expect
 
our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
194
 
million
 
shares.
 
In
 
closing,
 
while
 
we
 
are
 
thoughtfully
 
navigating
 
the
 
near-term
 
softness
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
end
 
markets,
 
we
 
expect
 
our
 
significant
 
design
 
wins
 
and
 
the
 
technology
 
advances
 
that
 
are
 
enabling
 
new
 
market
 
developments
 
in
 
AI
 
data
 
center,
 
solar
 
microinverters,
 
EV
 
and
 
broader
 
new
 
energy
 
markets
 
to
 
put
 
us
 
in
 
a
 
strong
 
position
 
to
 
drive
 
growth
 
later
 
this
 
year
 
and
 
throughout
 
2026.
 
Operator,
 
let's
 
begin
 
the
 
Q&A
 
session.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
And
 
our
 
first
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
with
 
Deutsche
 
Bank.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
Gene,
 
I
 
guess
 
the
 
first
 
one
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
visibility
 
into
 
the
 
second
 
half.
 
And
 
generally,
 
the
 
$450
 
million
 
of
 
design
 
wins
 
you
 
talked
 
about,
 
any
 
change
 
in
 
the
 
timing
 
or
 
magnitude
 
of
 
those?
 
I
 
just
 
hope
 
you
 
could
 
kind
 
of
 
walk
 
us
 
through
 
in
 
a
 
general
 
sense.
 
I
 
know
 
visibility
 
is
 
probably
 
still
 
somewhat
 
limited
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half.
 
But
 
in
 
a
 
general
 
sense,
 
how
 
you
 
see
 
those
 
rolling
 
out
 
as
 
we
 
look
 
into
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
this
 
year
 
and
 
then
 
2026?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Well,
 
yes,
 
definitely.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
your
 
question,
 
Ross.
 
And
 
it's
 
worth
 
repeating
 
the
 
$450
 
million
 
design
 
wins
 
was
 
pretty
 
extraordinary
 
last
 
year.
 
Our
 
focus
 
this
 
year
 
is
 
on
 
converting
 
those
 
from
 
wins
 
to
 
production
 
orders.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
that's
 
lifetime
 
revenue.
 
So
 
it
 
can
 
span
 
from
 
1
 
year
 
on
 
mobile
 
to
 
maybe
 
a
 
few
 
years
 
on
 
the
 
high-power
 
markets.
 
And
 
that
 
revenue
 
kicks
 
in
 
over
 
3
 
years,
 
either
 
late
 
this
 
year,
 
most
 
--
 
a
 
good
 
percentage
 
of
 
late
 
this
 
year,
 
the
 
vast
 
majority
 
in
 
'26,
 
and
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
them
 
in
 
'27.
 
So
 
it
 
does
 
depend
 
on
 
the
 
start
 
time
 
and
 
the
 
ramp
 
time
 
of
 
them
 
all.
 
But
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
outlook
 
to
 
converting
 
those
 
design
 
wins
 
into
 
purchase
 
orders,
 
which
 
is
 
why
 
we
 
feel
 
despite
 
some
 
headwinds
 
in
 
the
 
overall
 
semiconductor
 
downturn,
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
unknowns
 
here
 
with
 
tariffs,
 
as
 
Todd
 
described,
 
we
 
feel
 
good
 
about
 
driving
 
solid
 
growth
 
late
 
in
 
the
 
year
 
and
 
setting
 
up
 
a
 
really
 
strong
 
2026,
 
largely
 
because
 
of
 
those
 
design
 
wins,
 
which
 
we
 
expect
 
will
 
actually
 
accelerate
 
with
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
technology
 
announcements
 
we
 
made
 
in
 
Q1.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
Then
 
I
 
guess
 
one
 
for
 
Todd
 
on
 
the
 
profitability
 
side
 
of
 
things.
 
Anything
 
changed
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
how
 
long
 
you're
 
planning
 
to
 
stick
 
at
 
kind
 
of
 
the
 
$15.5
 
million
 
on
 
the
 
OpEx
 
side
 
and
 
the
 
goal
 
to
 
reach
 
EBITDA
 
breakeven
 
sometime,
 
I
 
guess,
 
the
 
timing
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
different,
 
but
 
the
 
revenues
 
are
 
kind
 
of
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
in,
 
I
 
guess,
 
the
 
mid-
 
to
 
upper
 
30s
 
per
 
quarter.
 
Is
 
that
 
still
 
the
 
bogey?
 
And
 
anything
 
has
 
changed
 
on
 
that
 
front?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes,
 
nothing
 
really
 
has
 
changed
 
there.
 
We're
 
still
 
tracking
 
to
 
that
 
target
 
of
 
15.5%
 
on
 
OpEx
 
and
 
expect
 
to
 
stay
 
at
 
those
 
levels.
 
And
 
then
 
as
 
we
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
prior
 
call,
 
we're
 
still
 
tracking
 
to
 
that
 
breakeven
 
in
 
the
 
high
 
30s,
 
which
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
happen
 
in
 
2026.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
with
 
Charter
 
Equity
 
Research.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
So
 
because
 
Navitas,
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
applications
 
like
 
automotive
 
and
 
data
 
centers
 
that
 
can
 
use
 
both
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
and/or
 
GaN.
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
curious,
 
how
 
do
 
your
 
total
 
design
 
wins
 
and
 
pipeline
 
break
 
down
 
between
 
the
 
2
 
materials?
 
I
 
mean,
 
is
 
it
 
similar
 
to
 
how
 
your
 
actual
 
revenue
 
is
 
today
 
where
 
it's
 
predominantly
 
GaN?
 
Or
 
is
 
it
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
balanced?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Great
 
question,
 
Jack,
 
and
 
that's
 
a
 
really
 
important
 
point
 
because
 
EV,
 
specifically
 
onboard
 
chargers,
 
are
 
really
 
ideal
 
for
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
stage,
 
GaN
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
stage,
 
almost
 
identical
 
situation
 
for
 
AI
 
data
 
centers,
 
ideal,
 
in
 
fact,
 
the
 
12-kilowatt,
 
the
 
8.5
 
kilowatt,
 
almost
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
designs
 
are
 
using
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
stage
 
for
 
PFC
 
gallium
 
nitride,
 
where
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
kind
 
of
 
screaming
 
fast
 
and
 
high
 
efficiency
 
in
 
that
 
second
 
stage.
 
And
 
then
 
we're
 
really
 
growing
 
nicely
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
into
 
more
 
commercial
 
EV,
 
higher
 
power
 
industrial.
 
I
 
really
 
highlighted
 
the
 
high
 
reliability,
 
high
 
voltage,
 
and
 
high-power,
 
and
 
high-power
 
capability
 
of
 
our
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
that's
 
winning
 
in
 
its
 
own
 
right
 
and
 
certain
 
high-power
 
markets,
 
just
 
like
 
GaN
 
is
 
doing
 
really
 
well
 
in
 
the
 
low-power
 
markets
 
like
 
appliance,
 
and
 
the
 
mobile,
 
of
 
course,
 
is
 
our
 
traditional
 
strength.
 
So
 
when
 
you
 
apply
 
that
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
pipeline,
 
and
 
it
 
was
 
$2.4
 
billion
 
last
 
year,
 
$450
 
million
 
design
 
wins,
 
lifetime
 
wins,
 
while
 
we
 
don't
 
break
 
it
 
out
 
by
 
GaN
 
Sq,
 
it's
 
very
 
well
 
balanced
 
between
 
the
 
2.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
vary,
 
of
 
course,
 
by
 
segment,
 
but
 
it's
 
quite
 
well
 
balanced
 
and
 
not
 
at
 
all
 
indicative
 
of
 
the
 
near-term
 
revenue
 
split
 
where
 
we've
 
seen
 
that
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
drop
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
industry
 
slowdown
 
and
 
pockets
 
of
 
channel
 
inventory,
 
while
 
GaN
 
is
 
kind
 
of
 
at
 
an
 
all-time
 
high.
 
So
 
we
 
see
 
them
 
much
 
more
 
balanced
 
going
 
forward
 
based
 
on
 
that
 
pipeline.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
noticed
 
that
 
R&D
 
declined
 
quite
 
a
 
bit,
 
where
 
SG&A
 
was
 
actually
 
up
 
or
 
MG&A
 
was
 
up
 
a
 
bit
 
in
 
the
 
quarter.
 
I
 
mean,
 
can
 
you
 
just
 
discuss
 
that
 
a
 
bit?
 
Is
 
that
 
going
 
to
 
limit
 
your
 
ability
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
next-generation
 
tech
 
at
 
all?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
No.
 
I
 
think
 
if
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
Q1
 
in
 
a
 
nutshell,
 
SG&A
 
is
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
higher
 
as
 
we
 
have
 
one-time
 
expenses
 
related
 
to
 
sort
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
reductions
 
and
 
audit
 
fees.
 
So
 
that's
 
not
 
our
 
typical
 
spend
 
there.
 
I
 
think
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
forward
 
into
 
2025
 
compared
 
to
 
'24,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
split
 
being
 
around
 
55%
 
R&D
 
versus
 
45%
 
SG&A.
 
So
 
there
 
shouldn't
 
be
 
a
 
change
 
in
 
our
 
split.
 
We're
 
just
 
bringing
 
the
 
levels
 
down
 
proportionately
 
from
 
where
 
we
 
were
 
before.
 
Operator
 
The
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
with
 
CJS
 
Securities,
 
Inc.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
specific
 
details
 
on
 
your
 
exposure
 
to
 
China,
 
maybe
 
the
 
ASP
 
per
 
unit
 
you're
 
selling
 
into
 
China.
 
And
 
if
 
the
 
tariff
 
situation
 
has
 
been
 
enough
 
to
 
cause
 
customers
 
to
 
maybe
 
dial
 
back
 
their
 
plans
 
or
 
pause
 
them
 
or
 
maybe
 
even
 
try
 
to,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
second
 
source
 
or
 
design
 
you
 
out
 
of
 
prior
 
design
 
wins.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Jon.
 
Well,
 
first,
 
as
 
Todd
 
described
 
on
 
the
 
GaN,
 
we
 
don't
 
see
 
much
 
risk
 
or
 
impact.
 
Taiwan
 
manufacturing
 
isn't
 
a
 
target
 
or
 
impacted
 
by
 
China
 
tariffs.
 
Our
 
U.S.
 
exposure
 
there
 
is
 
pretty
 
small,
 
even
 
if
 
there
 
was
 
an
 
eventual
 
Taiwan
 
tariff
 
to
 
kick
 
in.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
conversation
 
is
 
mainly
 
around
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
As
 
Todd
 
described,
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
today
 
is
 
a
 
minority
 
of
 
our
 
total
 
revenue.
 
But
 
a
 
majority
 
of
 
that
 
minority,
 
if
 
you
 
will,
 
is
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
shipping
 
into
 
China.
 
So
 
that's
 
where
 
the
 
rest
 
could
 
be.
 
Actually,
 
the
 
country
 
of
 
origin
 
today
 
defined
 
by
 
China
 
tariffs
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
packaging
 
location.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
China
 
for
 
China
 
strategy
 
that
 
I
 
think
 
serves
 
us
 
really
 
well
 
in
 
these
 
geopolitically
 
complicated
 
times.
 
Most
 
of
 
our
 
packaging
 
is
 
in
 
China.
 
So
 
as
 
it's
 
literally
 
defined
 
today,
 
we
 
shouldn't
 
be
 
exposed
 
to
 
tariffs,
 
and
 
we're
 
not
 
having
 
an
 
immediate
 
impact
 
to
 
tariffs.
 
There
 
is
 
speculation
 
though,
 
that
 
if
 
that
 
country
 
of
 
origin
 
should
 
change
 
to
 
fab
 
location,
 
that
 
could
 
have
 
an
 
impact
 
because
 
our
 
fab
 
location
 
is
 
U.S.
 
So
 
that's
 
a
 
little
 
speculative,
 
and
 
that's
 
why
 
we
 
emphasize
 
it's
 
dynamic.
 
We're
 
keeping
 
an
 
eye
 
on
 
it.
 
Maybe
 
it
 
could
 
have
 
an
 
adverse
 
impact
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
year.
 
That's
 
really
 
what
 
we're
 
trying
 
to
 
judge.
 
The
 
flip
 
side
 
of
 
that
 
is
 
actually
 
a
 
really
 
good
 
strength.
 
We
 
have
 
U.S.
 
country-of-origin
 
manufacturing
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
That's
 
a
 
strategic
 
region.
 
We
 
see
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
And
 
there,
 
not
 
only
 
we'll
 
be
 
avoiding
 
tariffs,
 
we
 
see
 
that
 
as
 
a
 
really
 
positive
 
for
 
our
 
U.S.
 
customers.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
And
 
maybe
 
just
 
to
 
expand
 
on
 
the
 
subject
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more,
 
and
 
looking
 
forward,
 
let's
 
say,
 
the
 
tariffs
 
stay
 
in
 
place
 
or
 
they
 
stay
 
fairly
 
high.
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
plans
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
horizon
 
to
 
maybe
 
expand
 
your
 
foundry
 
base
 
to
 
other
 
places
 
where
 
you
 
can
 
produce
 
SiC
 
outside
 
of
 
the
 
U.S.
 
or
 
GaN
 
inside?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
That's
 
exactly
 
right.
 
Nothing
 
to
 
formally
 
announce,
 
but
 
we
 
have
 
things
 
well
 
underway
 
that
 
could
 
move
 
us
 
into
 
different
 
territories
 
should
 
that
 
kind
 
of
 
worst-case
 
scenario
 
happen
 
that
 
would
 
work
 
around
 
those
 
trended
 
tariffs
 
over
 
time.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Madison
 
DePaola
 
with
 
Rosenblatt
 
Securities.
 
Madison
 
DePaola
 
Could
 
you
 
guys
 
just
 
provide
 
some
 
more
 
color
 
on
 
the
 
traction
 
that
 
you're
 
seeing
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
center
 
vertical?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
definitely,
 
Maddi.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
the
 
question.
 
We've
 
come
 
a
 
long
 
way
 
from
 
2.7
 
kilowatts
 
to
 
3.2,
 
4.5,
 
most
 
recently,
 
8.5
 
and
 
now
 
today,
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
announcing
 
12
 
kilowatts,
 
the
 
details
 
of
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
fully
 
rolled
 
out
 
at
 
Computex
 
later
 
this
 
month.
 
So
 
that's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
progress.
 
On
 
the
 
one
 
hand,
 
we've
 
been
 
pleased
 
that
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
customers
 
have
 
adopted
 
GaN
 
or
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
even
 
when
 
they
 
didn't
 
really
 
have
 
to
 
for
 
performance
 
reasons.
 
I
 
think
 
even
 
at
 
the
 
lower
 
power
 
levels,
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
GaN
 
or
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
Some
 
have
 
tried
 
it
 
out
 
because
 
they
 
know
 
that's
 
the
 
future,
 
and
 
they
 
better
 
get
 
on
 
with
 
learning
 
the
 
design,
 
maturing
 
the
 
design,
 
proving
 
it
 
out
 
in
 
their
 
production.
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
Blackwell
 
has
 
gone
 
to
 
production
 
with
 
4
 
to
 
5-kilowatt
 
designs.
 
Many
 
of
 
those
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
with
 
silicon
 
today.
 
Again,
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
gallium
 
nitride
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
probably
 
slowed
 
down
 
what
 
we
 
hope
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
bigger
 
ramp
 
this
 
year.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
once
 
you
 
get
 
to
 
8.5,
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
a
 
real
 
turning
 
point.
 
Very,
 
very
 
difficult
 
to
 
design
 
the
 
8.5
 
kilowatt
 
with
 
the
 
density,
 
with
 
the
 
efficiencies
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
without
 
going
 
to
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
And
 
I
 
would
 
venture
 
to
 
say
 
impossible
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
12-kilowatt
 
that
 
we
 
just
 
announced
 
without
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
technologies,
 
and
 
even
 
uniquely
 
ours
 
arguably.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
gives
 
you
 
some
 
color.
 
I
 
also
 
mentioned
 
the
 
other
 
way
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
this
 
is
 
rack
 
power,
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
power
 
supply
 
itself.
 
Each
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
power
 
supplies
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about,
 
you
 
can
 
put
 
6
 
across
 
the
 
shelf
 
or
 
tray,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
have
 
multiple
 
shelves
 
assigned
 
to
 
power.
 
The
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
rack
 
or
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
shelves
 
would
 
go
 
towards
 
the
 
processing,
 
Blackwell,
 
et
 
cetera.
 
So
 
while
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
Blackwells
 
have
 
started
 
with
 
4
 
or
 
5
 
kilowatts,
 
that
 
might
 
get
 
you
 
to
 
a
 
50
 
or
 
100-kilowatt
 
type
 
of
 
rack
 
power.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
listen
 
to
 
NVIDIA
 
and
 
anybody
 
else,
 
where
 
this
 
is
 
headed,
 
we're
 
very
 
quickly
 
going
 
to
 
250
 
to
 
400
 
to
 
500
 
kilowatts
 
and
 
then
 
maybe
 
headed
 
towards
 
1
 
megawatt
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
few
 
years.
 
Those
 
are
 
pretty
 
crazy
 
numbers,
 
and
 
it's
 
hard
 
to
 
imagine
 
achieving
 
those
 
without
 
going
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
8.5
 
and
 
now
 
I
 
think,
 
frankly,
 
12
 
kilowatt,
 
which,
 
as
 
I
 
said,
 
gets
 
you
 
really
 
close
 
to
 
that
 
0.5
 
megawatt.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
sets
 
us
 
up
 
really
 
well
 
for
 
any
 
new
 
Blackwell
 
or
 
Blackwell
 
Ultra
 
designs,
 
and
 
of
 
course,
 
really
 
well
 
positioned
 
for
 
Rubin,
 
which
 
would
 
come
 
late
 
next
 
year.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
We'll
 
take
 
our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
with
 
Craig-Hallum
 
Capital
 
Group.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
I
 
guess
 
I'll
 
ask
 
the
 
first
 
one
 
on
 
solar,
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
multiparter
 
here.
 
Can
 
you
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
better
 
sense
 
of
 
when
 
you're
 
expecting
 
to
 
see
 
this
 
ramp
 
at
 
some
 
point
 
later
 
this
 
year?
 
And
 
as
 
I
 
recall,
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
you've
 
talked
 
about
 
this,
 
this
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
design
 
you
 
expect
 
to
 
be
 
multisource.
 
Maybe
 
you
 
can
 
discuss
 
where
 
your
 
position
 
there
 
is?
 
And
 
then
 
lastly,
 
are
 
you
 
seeing
 
any
 
other
 
microinverter
 
customers
 
moving
 
towards
 
GaN
 
and
 
a
 
possibility
 
using
 
Navitas?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Yes.
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Rich,
 
for
 
bringing
 
it
 
up.
 
We
 
didn't
 
put
 
a
 
spotlight
 
on
 
it
 
too
 
much.
 
But
 
number
 
one,
 
it's
 
super
 
exciting
 
to
 
see
 
GaN
 
going
 
into
 
3
 
new
 
markets
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
months,
 
AI
 
data
 
centers
 
already
 
ramping,
 
solar
 
microinverters
 
in
 
particular,
 
as
 
you
 
pointed
 
out,
 
ramping
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
GaN
 
going
 
into
 
EV
 
early
 
next
 
year.
 
So
 
we've
 
got
 
quite
 
a
 
sequence
 
of
 
events
 
in
 
opening
 
up
 
new
 
mainstream
 
markets.
 
And
 
not
 
only
 
is
 
microinverters
 
adopting
 
GaN,
 
it's
 
adopting
 
GaN
 
bidirectional
 
switches,
 
which
 
is,
 
as
 
I
 
highlighted,
 
really
 
the
 
most
 
ideal
 
switch
 
the
 
industry
 
has
 
ever
 
seen.
 
It
 
can
 
handle
 
high
 
currents
 
and
 
high
 
voltages,
 
delivering
 
those
 
currents
 
and
 
blocking
 
those
 
voltages
 
inherently
 
in
 
both
 
directions,
 
but
 
does
 
it
 
with
 
super
 
high
 
frequency
 
and
 
high
 
efficiency
 
of
 
GaN.
 
That's
 
pretty
 
exciting
 
stuff
 
and
 
makes
 
a
 
ton
 
of
 
sense
 
for
 
microinverters.
 
So
 
yes,
 
those
 
are
 
still
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
half.
 
We
 
are
 
seeing
 
Q3
 
ramp
 
a
 
little
 
lower
 
than
 
expected.
 
More
 
of
 
that
 
revenue
 
starts
 
in
 
Q4,
 
and
 
the
 
really
 
big
 
numbers
 
are
 
next
 
year.
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
feel
 
good.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
multisourced,
 
as
 
you
 
pointed
 
out.
 
Those
 
final
 
commercial
 
negotiations
 
are
 
not
 
done.
 
They'll
 
be
 
done
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
quarter.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
feel
 
good
 
about
 
our
 
position
 
being
 
the
 
first
 
GaN
 
bidirectional
 
switch
 
actually
 
production
 
released
 
in
 
Q1,
 
as
 
I
 
highlighted,
 
that's
 
another
 
major
 
first.
 
We've
 
got
 
a
 
really
 
important
 
advantage
 
in
 
our
 
proprietary
 
substrate
 
clamp,
 
which
 
makes
 
the
 
part
 
really
 
reliable
 
and
 
really
 
robust.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
all
 
that
 
positions
 
us
 
well
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
good
 
share
 
and
 
ramp
 
that
 
up
 
as
 
expected
 
late
 
in
 
the
 
year.
 
And
 
again,
 
pretty
 
big
 
numbers
 
next
 
year.
 
We
 
already
 
have
 
other
 
microinverter
 
companies
 
that
 
have
 
approached
 
us
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
6
 
months,
 
starting
 
new
 
designs.
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
any
 
of
 
them
 
will
 
get
 
to
 
production
 
this
 
year,
 
but
 
I
 
expect
 
to
 
see
 
other
 
solar
 
microinverter
 
guys
 
starting
 
next
 
year.
 
And
 
to
 
the
 
broader
 
message,
 
GaN
 
BDS,
 
again,
 
will
 
go
 
into
 
EV
 
onboard
 
chargers
 
and
 
other
 
energy
 
storage
 
systems.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
we'll
 
see
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
going
 
into
 
production
 
next
 
year
 
as
 
well.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
My
 
follow-on
 
question
 
here
 
is
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
getting
 
a
 
top-down
 
understanding
 
here
 
of
 
dollar
 
growth
 
as
 
we
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
year,
 
year
 
plus.
 
What
 
kind
 
of
 
you
 
pick
 
your
 
time
 
frame
 
in
 
2026,
 
as
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
new
 
applications
 
develop.
 
But
 
if
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
EV,
 
solar,
 
industrial,
 
and
 
I'm
 
probably
 
forgetting
 
any
 
others,
 
data
 
center.
 
Like
 
is
 
there
 
ones
 
that
 
have
 
a
 
more
 
disproportionate
 
contribution
 
to
 
the
 
dollar
 
growth
 
from
 
the
 
starting
 
point
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
it's
 
a
 
good
 
question.
 
Certainly,
 
if
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
pipeline,
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
design
 
wins,
 
I
 
know
 
we
 
didn't
 
break
 
it
 
down
 
in
 
incredible
 
detail,
 
but
 
it's
 
really
 
well
 
distributed.
 
I
 
mean,
 
solid
 
wins.
 
We
 
gave
 
the
 
total
 
of
 
$450
 
million
 
of
 
lifetime
 
wins
 
last
 
year.
 
That
 
was
 
pretty
 
solidly
 
distributed.
 
We
 
had
 
40
 
wins
 
in
 
data
 
center.
 
That's
 
now
 
up
 
to
 
75
 
in
 
total,
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
call.
 
We
 
had
 
40
 
wins
 
in
 
EV
 
e-mobility.
 
We
 
had
 
28
 
in
 
appliance
 
industrial.
 
We
 
actually
 
had
 
100
 
in
 
solar
 
and
 
energy
 
storage,
 
the
 
biggest
 
being
 
that
 
GaN
 
BDS
 
for
 
solar
 
microinverters,
 
and
 
another
 
180,
 
which
 
has
 
a
 
long
 
tail
 
in
 
the
 
mobile
 
consumer.
 
So
 
they
 
all
 
have
 
different
 
dollar
 
values,
 
of
 
course,
 
but
 
it
 
points
 
to
 
the
 
diversity.
 
So
 
it's
 
really
 
hard
 
to
 
pick
 
one.
 
Clearly,
 
we
 
put
 
a
 
strategic
 
focus
 
on
 
mobile,
 
EV,
 
and
 
AI
 
data
 
centers.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
those
 
are
 
the
 
3
 
that
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
biggest
 
drivers,
 
but
 
you've
 
got
 
to
 
give
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
credit
 
to
 
that
 
solar
 
microinverter,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
material
 
as
 
kind
 
of
 
the
 
fourth
 
driver
 
for
 
next
 
year.
 
So
 
hard
 
to
 
pick
 
one
 
to
 
be
 
far
 
above
 
the
 
other.
 
Certainly,
 
we
 
expect
 
the
 
new
 
markets
 
to
 
be
 
growing
 
even
 
faster
 
than
 
mobile,
 
which
 
is
 
why
 
we
 
expect
 
greater
 
market
 
diversification
 
next
 
year
 
and
 
commensurate
 
regional
 
diversification
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
grow
 
outside
 
China
 
faster
 
with
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
other
 
regions.
 
So
 
hopefully,
 
that
 
gives
 
you
 
a
 
little
 
color,
 
recognizing,
 
of
 
course,
 
we're
 
not
 
predicting
 
next
 
year's
 
revenue
 
or
 
how
 
that
 
would
 
break
 
out
 
by
 
market
 
or
 
technology.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
Just
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
general
 
sense,
 
and
 
that's
 
very
 
helpful,
 
Gene.
 
Operator
 
Next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
with
 
Charter
 
Equity
 
Research.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
I
 
was
 
hoping
 
you
 
could
 
update
 
us
 
on
 
the
 
at-the-market
 
offering
 
that
 
was
 
announced
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
March
 
quarter.
 
Your
 
cash
 
burn
 
was
 
about
 
the
 
same
 
rate
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
last
 
quarter.
 
So
 
did
 
you
 
actually
 
execute
 
the
 
offering?
 
Or
 
was
 
it
 
just
 
to
 
have
 
it
 
on
 
hand
 
in
 
case
 
you
 
need
 
it?
 
And
 
then
 
will
 
it
 
be
 
for
 
anything
 
in
 
particular?
 
Or
 
is
 
it
 
just
 
to
 
give
 
Navitas
 
more
 
runway?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes.
 
No,
 
that's
 
a
 
great
 
question.
 
Correct.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
offering
 
out
 
there.
 
We
 
have
 
not
 
executed
 
upon
 
it.
 
It's
 
there
 
in
 
case
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
for
 
strategic
 
reasons,
 
if
 
we
 
need
 
some
 
extra
 
strategic
 
capital.
 
As
 
you
 
noticed,
 
right,
 
our
 
cash
 
usage
 
in
 
Q1
 
was
 
only
 
$11
 
million,
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
$75
 
million
 
on
 
our
 
balance
 
sheet.
 
So
 
that
 
provides
 
us
 
quite
 
a
 
runway
 
going
 
forward,
 
7-plus
 
quarters
 
if
 
we
 
maintain
 
this
 
level.
 
But
 
as
 
we
 
expect
 
revenue
 
to
 
grow
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
towards
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
we
 
expect
 
our
 
cash
 
usage
 
to
 
go
 
down.
 
So
 
right
 
now,
 
we
 
are
 
just
 
having
 
the
 
ATM
 
out
 
there
 
for
 
strategic
 
purposes.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
guess
 
I'll
 
just
 
get
 
a
 
quick
 
second
 
one
 
here.
 
With
 
bidirectional
 
GaN
 
switch
 
is
 
ramping
 
this
 
year,
 
Gen,
 
could
 
you
 
just
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
general
 
sense
 
of
 
the
 
total
 
revenue
 
potential
 
for
 
next
 
year
 
for
 
bidirectional
 
GaN?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Yes.
 
Again,
 
we're
 
not
 
guiding.
 
But
 
certainly,
 
revenue
 
potential,
 
I
 
would
 
certainly
 
put
 
it
 
north
 
of
 
$10
 
million.
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
a
 
conservative
 
view
 
across
 
the
 
different
 
applications
 
and
 
things.
 
It's
 
pretty
 
dynamic.
 
Obviously,
 
it's
 
new.
 
We've
 
got
 
over
 
a
 
dozen
 
new
 
opportunities.
 
Many
 
dozens
 
have
 
been
 
sampled.
 
So
 
it's
 
definitely
 
growing
 
by
 
the
 
day.
 
I
 
would
 
put
 
it
 
certainly
 
north
 
of
 
double-digit
 
millions
 
for
 
next
 
year.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Joe
 
Moore
 
with
 
Morgan
 
Stanley.
 
Joseph
 
Moore
 
I'm
 
going
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
AI
 
data
 
center.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
guess
 
I
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
timing.
 
It
 
seems
 
like
 
when
 
you
 
sort
 
of
 
say
 
Blackwell
 
designs
 
from
 
here
 
could
 
use
 
your
 
technology.
 
Just
 
I
 
would
 
think
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
Blackwell
 
current
 
generation
 
designs
 
are
 
done
 
already.
 
Just
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
sense
 
for
 
like
 
how
 
that
 
can
 
layer
 
in
 
and
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
this
 
is
 
kind
 
of
 
more
 
of
 
a
 
Rubin
 
play.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
definitely,
 
Joe.
 
So
 
we're
 
seeing
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
different
 
configurations,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
ongoing
 
new
 
Blackwell
 
designs.
 
So
 
obviously,
 
people
 
have
 
not
 
moved
 
on
 
to
 
Blackwell
 
Ultra
 
and
 
Rubin
 
sometime
 
next
 
year.
 
So
 
we
 
still
 
see
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
opportunity
 
to
 
intersect
 
into
 
Blackwell.
 
Case
 
in
 
point,
 
we
 
had
 
40
 
wins
 
last
 
year.
 
It's
 
now
 
up
 
to
 
75,
 
including
 
things
 
that
 
are
 
already
 
starting
 
to
 
ramp
 
minimally
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
half,
 
including
 
that
 
40
 
wins
 
from
 
last
 
year.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
see
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
different
 
configurations.
 
It's
 
still
 
pretty
 
dynamic.
 
How
 
many
 
Blackwells
 
are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
put
 
in
 
the
 
rack?
 
How
 
much
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
upgrade
 
that
 
rack
 
from
 
50
 
kilowatts
 
to
 
100
 
or
 
100
 
or
 
150?
 
And
 
how
 
much
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
move
 
away
 
from
 
traditional
 
power
 
supply
 
designs
 
that
 
use
 
silicon
 
that
 
might
 
be
 
3,
 
4,
 
5
 
kilowatts
 
to
 
where
 
you're
 
pushing
 
to
 
8.5
 
or
 
now
 
12
 
kilowatts,
 
which
 
are
 
inevitably
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
quite
 
dynamic.
 
We
 
still
 
see
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
opportunities
 
for
 
intersection
 
with
 
Blackwell.
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
will
 
grow
 
from
 
there
 
to
 
Ultra.
 
And
 
then
 
I'm
 
sure
 
we'll
 
see
 
even
 
better
 
opportunities
 
with
 
Rubin.
 
Joseph
 
Moore
 
And
 
then
 
just
 
going
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
balance
 
sheet
 
question
 
you
 
were
 
just
 
asked
 
in
 
terms
 
of,
 
there's
 
a
 
scenario
 
where
 
revenue
 
picks
 
up
 
quite
 
a
 
bit,
 
and
 
you're
 
fine.
 
I
 
guess
 
if
 
we
 
sort
 
of
 
remain
 
in
 
a
 
kind
 
of
 
tariff
 
malaise,
 
things
 
like
 
that,
 
just
 
can
 
you
 
talk
 
about
 
contingency
 
plans
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
cash
 
burn
 
under
 
different
 
revenue
 
scenarios?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes.
 
So
 
right
 
now,
 
we're
 
keeping
 
our
 
cash
 
pretty
 
tight
 
on
 
the
 
working
 
capital
 
elements
 
there.
 
Because
 
of
 
that
 
and
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
reduction
 
in
 
OpEx,
 
we're
 
able
 
to
 
keep
 
that
 
cash
 
really
 
much
 
smaller
 
going
 
forward,
 
and
 
we
 
expect
 
that
 
to
 
happen
 
in
 
a
 
sort
 
of
 
slower
 
growth
 
element
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
an
 
accelerated
 
growth
 
in
 
Q4.
 
So
 
we
 
really
 
don't
 
see
 
any
 
concerns
 
there
 
today,
 
given
 
our
 
cash
 
levels
 
and
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
sort
 
of
 
keep
 
our
 
working
 
capital
 
in
 
check.
 
Operator
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
follow-up
 
question
 
from
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
with
 
Deutsche
 
Bank.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
Just
 
wanted
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
inventory
 
burn
 
in
 
the
 
general
 
market.
 
We've
 
heard
 
some
 
green
 
shoots
 
from
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
industrial
 
end
 
markets.
 
Just,
 
Gene,
 
what's
 
your
 
view
 
on
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
inventory
 
in
 
the
 
channel
 
for
 
you?
 
Are
 
you
 
seeing
 
that
 
starting
 
to
 
normalize
 
so
 
you
 
could
 
get
 
growth,
 
more
 
of
 
the
 
cyclical
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
equation
 
than
 
the
 
company-specific
 
design
 
wins?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
yes,
 
definitely,
 
Ross.
 
Yes,
 
certainly,
 
it
 
was
 
more
 
broadly
 
spread
 
last
 
year.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
mainly
 
a
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
phenomenon.
 
The
 
3
 
markets
 
slowed
 
down
 
simultaneously
 
with
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
capacity
 
coming
 
on,
 
and
 
it
 
happened
 
relatively
 
quickly,
 
creating
 
a
 
decent
 
amount
 
of
 
widespread
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
inventory
 
in
 
the
 
channels
 
throughout
 
the
 
globe.
 
And
 
now
 
we've
 
talked
 
about
 
really
 
specific
 
pockets
 
of
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
inventory.
 
It's
 
definitely
 
declined.
 
We're
 
seeing
 
good
 
sell-through
 
and
 
healthy
 
channel
 
inventory
 
in
 
many
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
world,
 
but
 
we're
 
still
 
not
 
there
 
yet.
 
We're
 
not
 
in
 
a
 
healthy
 
place.
 
So
 
we
 
think
 
it's
 
a
 
quarter
 
or
 
2
 
away
 
where
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
remaining
 
overhang
 
is
 
behind
 
us
 
and
 
just
 
adds
 
to
 
our
 
bullishness
 
for
 
resuming
 
growth
 
not
 
only
 
on
 
silicon
 
carbide,
 
but
 
of
 
course,
 
continuing
 
growth
 
on
 
GaN
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
year.
 
Operator
 
And
 
our
 
last
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
with
 
Needham.
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
This
 
is
 
Nick
 
Doyle
 
on
 
for
 
Quinn.
 
Just
 
wanted
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
your
 
customers
 
are
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
smartphone
 
market
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
unit
 
growth
 
in
 
2025?
 
And
 
how
 
does
 
that
 
compare
 
to
 
your
 
own
 
mobile
 
outlook?
 
And
 
really,
 
are
 
you
 
seeing
 
any
 
signs
 
of
 
pull
 
in
 
or
 
push
 
out
 
related
 
to
 
tariffs?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Nick.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
bringing
 
it
 
up.
 
We
 
obviously
 
didn't
 
put
 
a
 
spotlight
 
on
 
mobile.
 
It
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
important,
 
stable,
 
and
 
growing
 
part
 
of
 
our
 
business.
 
Last
 
year,
 
we
 
estimated
 
the
 
adoption
 
rate
 
around
 
10%
 
globally.
 
Of
 
particular
 
note,
 
Xiaomi
 
and
 
OPO
 
jumped
 
up
 
quite
 
a
 
bit.
 
I
 
think
 
they
 
doubled
 
their
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
to
 
around
 
30%
 
of
 
all
 
of
 
their
 
phones
 
being
 
with
 
GaN,
 
as
 
they're
 
pushing
 
the
 
power
 
levels
 
to
 
65
 
watts
 
and
 
higher
 
faster
 
than
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
regions
 
and
 
suppliers.
 
We
 
think
 
that
 
the
 
same
 
trend
 
continues
 
to
 
suppliers
 
around
 
the
 
world.
 
We
 
don't
 
see
 
huge
 
jumps
 
up
 
this
 
year
 
where
 
we
 
would
 
have
 
reflected
 
that
 
in
 
our
 
outlook.
 
But
 
mobile
 
is
 
pretty
 
dynamic.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
end
 
market
 
to
 
your
 
question,
 
the
 
end
 
market
 
is
 
not
 
growing
 
a
 
ton,
 
and
 
it
 
doesn't
 
need
 
to,
 
which
 
more
 
than
 
smartphones
 
growing
 
2%
 
or
 
5%,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
when
 
are
 
they
 
going
 
to
 
double
 
their
 
GaN
 
lineup
 
to
 
go
 
from
 
10%
 
share
 
to
 
20%
 
or
 
20%
 
to
 
30%.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
inevitably
 
going
 
to
 
happen,
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
all
 
chargers,
 
we
 
believe,
 
30
 
watts
 
and
 
higher,
 
especially
 
where
 
we're
 
in
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
leadership
 
position
 
at
 
65
 
watts
 
and
 
higher.
 
So
 
it's
 
dynamic.
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
trends
 
are
 
strong.
 
If
 
we
 
can
 
confirm
 
big
 
jump-ups
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
year,
 
that
 
would
 
only
 
add
 
to
 
our
 
bullish
 
outlook
 
for
 
resuming
 
more
 
solid
 
growth
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
year.

As
 
a
 
follow-up,
 
you
 
talked
 
about
 
a
 
channel
 
slowdown
 
in
 
EV,
 
industrial,
 
and
 
ESS.
 
Is
 
that
 
more
 
demand-related?
 
Or
 
we're
 
still
 
seeing
 
pockets
 
of
 
inventory
 
like
 
you
 
kind
 
of
 
talked
 
about
 
earlier?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
Nick,
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
both.
 
And
 
the
 
typical
 
semiconductor
 
stuff.
 
I
 
mean,
 
we're
 
in
 
a
 
classic
 
semiconductor
 
downturn.
 
Silicon
 
carbide,
 
like
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
things,
 
was
 
growing
 
like
 
crazy.
 
They're
 
in
 
short
 
supply.
 
Once
 
all
 
of
 
a
 
sudden,
 
the
 
capacity
 
kicks
 
up,
 
the
 
demand
 
slows
 
down.
 
It's
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
double
 
whammy,
 
and
 
it's
 
hard
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
industry
 
to
 
adjust
 
quickly,
 
and
 
you
 
get
 
these
 
inventory
 
overhangs
 
or
 
channel
 
inventory
 
excesses,
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
whole
 
industry
 
has
 
got
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
working
 
through
 
those.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
we're
 
near
 
the
 
end,
 
as
 
I
 
said
 
earlier,
 
a
 
quarter
 
or
 
2
 
to
 
go.
 
And
 
hopefully,
 
that's
 
completely
 
behind
 
us.
 
Operator
 
Ladies
 
and
 
gentlemen,
 
that
 
concludes
 
the
 
question-and-answer
 
session.
 
Thank
 
you
 
all
 
for
 
joining,
 
and
 
you
 
may
 
now
 
disconnect.
