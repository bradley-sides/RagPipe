Travis Axelrod
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2025 Q&A  Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm
joined today by Elon Musk, V aibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives.
Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck made public to the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and
expectations as of today . Actual events or results could dif fer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most
recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]
Before we jump into Q&A, Elon will be providing an update. Elon?
Elon Musk
Hello, everyone. W ell, it's never a dull moment these days. W ell, thanks, for sure, every day is going to be exciting.
As people know , there's been some blowback for the time that I've been spending in government with the Department of Government Ef ficiency or DOGE.
I think the work that we're doing there is actually very important for trying to [ spin ] in the insane deficit that is leading our country , the United States, to
destruction. And the DOGE team has made a lot of progress in addressing waste and fraud.
The natural blowback from that is those who were receiving the wasteful dollars and the unfortunate dollars will try to attack me and the DOGE team and
anything associated with me.
So I'm really left with 2 choices. Should we just let the waste and fraud continue, and was continuing to grow at a really unsustainable pace that was
bankrupting the country or to fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.
And I believe the right thing to do is to fight the waste and fraud and get the country back in the right track and working together with President Trump and
his administration. Because if the ship of America goes down, we all go down with it, including Tesla and everyone else.
So I think this is critical work.
Now the purchase that you'll see out there, they're very organized. They're paid for . They're obviously not going to say -- admit that the reason that they're
protesting is because they're receiving fraudulent money or they're the recipients of waste largesse. But they're going to come up with some other reason.
But that is the real reason for the protests. The actual reason is that they're receiving the waste and fraud, wish to continue to keep receiving it. That is the
real thing that's going on here, obviously .
So now that said, I do think there's -- the large slug of work necessary to get the DOGE team in place and working in the government to get the financial
house in order is mostly done. And I think starting probably in next month, May , my time allocation at DOGE will drop significantly . I'll have to continue
doing it for I think we have the remainder of the President's term just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stopped does not come roaring back,
which we'll do if it has the chance.
So I think I'll continue to spend a day or 2 per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so, and as long as it is useful.
But starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla. And now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government
Efficiency is done.

So at Tesla, we've gone through many a crisis over the years and actually been through many near-death experiences.
I think we probably were in the edge of death at least on maybe a dozen times. It's been so many times. This is not one of those times. W e're not on edge
of death, not even close.
So there are some challenges, and I expect that this year will be -- there'll probably be some unexpected bumps this year . I remain extremely optimistic
about the future of the company .
The future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale autonomous cars and large-scale -- and large volume, vast numbers of autonomous
humanoid robots.
So the value of the company that makes truly useful autonomous humanoid robots and autonomous useful vehicles at scale at low cost, which is what
Tesla is going to do is staggering. I continue to believe that Tesla with excellent execution will be the most valuable company in the world by far .
But that's an important if. W e must execute well. But if we do execute well, I do -- I think Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far . It may
be as valuable as the next 5 companies combined. But there'll be a few bumps along the road before that happens. I said I think on the last earnings call
that we'll start to see the prosperity of autonomy take ef fect in a material way around the middle of next year .
We expect to have -- be selling fully autonomous rides in June in Austin as we've been saying for now several months.
So that's continued.
But the real question from a financial standpoint is when does it really become material and af fect the bottom line of the company and can start to be a
fundamental part of the -- when does it move the financial needle in a significant way? That's probably around the middle of next year , second half of next
year. And then once it does move the financial needle in a significant way , it will really go exponentially from there.
So that's -- I'd encourage people to look beyond like the sort of bumps and potholes of the road immediately ahead of us, but lift your gaze to the bright-
shining citadel on the hill, I don't know , some Reagan-esque imagery .
And that's where we're headed. And not too distant future, like I said, end of next year .
So let's see. With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply chains. It does actually
make sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint is to have the supply chains be at least located on the continent in which the car is
built.
And so we are, I think the least company -- the least af fected car company with respect to tarif fs, at least in most respects. I mean it remains to be seen.
Now tarif fs are still tough on a company when margins are still low . But we do have localized supply chains in both America, Europe, and China.
So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors. And undoubtedly , I'm going to get a lot of questions about tarif fs. And I just want to
emphasize that the tarif f decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he listens to
my advice but then it's up to him, of course, to make this decision.
I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tarif fs are generally a good idea for prosperity . But this decision is fundamentally up to the
elected representative of the people being the President of the United States.
So I'll continue to advocate for lower tarif fs rather than higher tarif fs but that's all I can do.
Now let me walk you through why I'm so excited about the future of Tesla.
So first of all, autonomy . The team and I are laser-focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June. Unsupervised autonomy will first be sold for the Model Y
in Austin, and then actually , should parse out the term for robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what's the Cybercab because we've got a product
called the Cybercab.
And then any Tesla, which could be an S, 3, X or Y that is autonomous is a robotic taxi or a robotaxi. It's very confusing.
So the vast majority of the Tesla fleet that we've made is capable of being a robotaxi or a robotic taxi. And we're going from -- once we can make the
system work where you can have paid rides, fully autonomously with no one in the car in 1 city , that is a very scalable thing for us to go broadly within
whatever jurisdiction allows us to operate .
So because what we're solving for is a general solution to autonomy , not a city-specific solution for autonomy , once we make it work in a few cities, we can
basically make it work in all cities in that legal jurisdiction.
So if it's -- once we can make the pace to work in a few cities in America, we can make it work anywhere in America. Once we can make it work in a few
cities in China, we can make it work anywhere in China, likewise in Europe, limited only by regulatory approvals.
So this is the advantage of having a generalized solution using artificial intelligence and an AI chip that Tesla designed specifically for this purpose, as
opposed to very expensive sensors and high-precision maps on a particular neighborhood where that neighborhood may change or often changes and
then the car stops working.
So we have a general solution instead of a specific solution.
And with regards to Optimus, making good progress in Optimus.
We expect to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this year beginning this fall. And we expect to see Optimus faster
than any product, I think, in history to get to millions of units per year as soon as possible.
I think we feel confident in getting to 1 million units per year in less than 5 years, maybe 4 years.
So by 2030, I feel confident in predicting 1 million Optimus units per year . It might be 2029.
So let's see, with respect to energy , our energy business is doing very well. The Megapack is -- it enables utility companies to output far more total energy
than would otherwise be the case. When you think of the energy capability of a grid, it's much more than the total energy output per year . If the power
plants could operate at peak power for all 24 hours as opposed to being at half power , sometimes quarter power at night, then you could double the
energy output of existing power plants.
And in order to do that, you need to buf fer the engines so that you can charge up something like a battery pack at night and then discharge into the grid
during the day .
So this is a massive unlock on total energy output of any given grid over the course of the year . And utility companies are beginning to realize this and are
buying Megapacks at scale.
So at this point, a gigawatt-class battery is quite a common thing.
So with many orders in the hopper for gigawatt and beyond batteries. And we expect the energy -- the stationary energy storage business to scale
ultimately to terawatts per year .
So very , very good numbers.
Now Q1 -- first quarters of a year are usually pretty tricky . It's usually the worst part of the year because people don't want to go buy a car in the middle of
a point during a blizzard.
So we picked Q1 as like a good quarter to do a cutover to the new version of the Model Y. And we changed production of the world's best-selling car . It's
worth remembering the Model Y is the best-selling car of any kind on Earth with 1.1 billion unit per year output of a single model.
And we did this changeover at the same time in the factories all across the world.
So congratulations to the Tesla team on an amazing job in pulling of f what is a very dif ficult transition.
So yes, it's really very impressive work.
So yes. In conclusion, while there are many near-term headwinds for us in the broader industry , the future for Tesla is brighter than ever . The value of the
company is delivering sustainable abundance with our af fordable AI-powered robots.
So this phrase, I like this phrase, sustainable abundance for all.
If you said like, what's the ideal future that you can imagine? That's what you'd want.
You'd want abundance for all in a way that's sustainable. It's good for the environment. Basically , this is a happy future.
If you say , what's the happiest future you can imagine? One which is that will be a future where there's sustainable abundance for all. Closest thing to
heaven we can get on Earth basically .
So thank you, again, to the Tesla team for all their ef forts after a challenging time and look forward to continuing to lead the team to great success in the
future.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much, Elon.
Before we move on, V aibhav has some opening remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja
Thanks, Elon.
As Elon mentioned, in Q1, we achieved something which has never been undertaken in the automotive industry of updating all our factories for the best-
selling car in the world all at the same time. And this is -- this -- people don't understand, this was not a small feat.
We are not aware of anybody else being able to do the best-selling car all at once within a quarter and that to hitting all the time lines which we had
established at the beginning.
So big kudos to the team for making this happen.
Additionally , we also hit a record gross profit for energy storage business in the quarter .
Now getting back into the business, there has been a lot of speculation as to the reasons for decline of our vehicle deliveries in the first quarter . We had
previously guided that we will be updating all factories, and this will lead to several weeks of lost production, which did happen as planned. The ripple
effect of the change is not having enough new Model Y available in most markets for people to see and experience through the last few weeks of the
quarter .
Additionally , the negative impact of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards our brand and our people had an impact in certain markets.  Despite this,
we were able to sell out legacy Model Y in U.S., China and a few other markets within the quarter . And again, just so people understand, we were
producing the legacy Model Y until middle to end of February . And we switched over and we were able to still sell out within that period.
So again, big achievement by all people at Tesla to make it happen.
We've been extremely -- we have a very extremely competitive vehicle lineup, which with most vehicles going through our recent update, and after that,
have advanced in FSD.
You have a personal chauf feur, which can take you almost anywhere under supervision. There are numerous stories shared by customers ranging from
how it has entailed a daily commute to providing mobility customers with disabilities to giving all the customers the ability to travel confidently and
independently . Not only is FSD supervised safer than a human driver , but it is also improving the lifestyle of individuals who experience it.
And again, this is something you have to experience and anybody who has experienced just knows it. And we've been doing a lot lately to try and get
those stories out, at least on X, so that people can see how other people have benefited from this.
Now coming into some of the financial stuf f. Auto margins declined sequentially , primarily due to the reduction in the total number of deliveries, l ower fixed
cost absorption due to factory changeovers and lower regulatory credit revenues, of fset slight -- by a slight increase in pricing due to the launch of new
Model Y despite incentives which we had to sell legacy Model Y.
On the Energy Storage business, like I said before, has achieved yet another milestone of create highest gross profit in the quarter . This was despite a
sequential decline in deployments. The importance of this business, as Elon mentioned, is pretty profound, especially in this environment because in order
for a grid to work properly with the demands from AI and all this, you need some more stability . And this is by far the simplest and best solution which we
are aware of which can help do this. And we have also developed certain unique solutions to help our customers to achieve this.
Additionally , on the Powerwall side, we've been selling the new Powerwall 3 and it's been received with very good reception from customers. And to the
extent that we are currently supply constrained. On services and other margins, they were slightly down sequentially , primarily because of the pressure on
our used car business and insurance business. Note that we continued our journey to improve profitability in our services and [ collision ] business through
labor productivity .
As previously discussed, our operating expenses continue to increase sequentially , primarily due to our AI-related initiatives, including Optimus and also
cost of development for our vehicle programs, including Cybercab, Semi and cheaper models. These expenses flow through R&D. W e believe even in the
current environment, it is the right strategy , making investments in these areas position us for the long term. These increases were of fset by decreases in
SG&A  from changes in our vehicle referral program.
Other income reduced significantly on a sequential basis. The primary reason was Bitcoin mark-to-market loss in Q1 versus gain in Q4, resulting in a $472
million drop. The remainder of the change is because of FX remeasurement.
With the adoption of the new mark-to-market standard for Bitcoin, we expect increased volatility in our other income in addition to the FX volatility .
I know tarif f is the hottest topic which people talk about, and it has various impacts to our business.
As Elon mentioned, on the vehicle business, we've been on this journey of regionalization for years.
Specifically in the U.S., Model Y has been rated the most American model made car on Cars.com made in America Index 3 years in a row . This in part is
of all the work which the team has been doing over the years. And to the extent that today , if you look at our vehicle lineup in U.S., we're about
approximately , on a weighted average basis, 85% USMCA  compliant.
So like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to other OEMs in terms of managing the tarif fs, but we're not immune because when
the Section 232 auto tarif fs become ef fective in May , which includes Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of our regionalization
strategy , they will have an impact on our profitability . And I know research modeling on this impact has been about a couple of thousand which is pretty
much in line with what we've been forecasting.
The impact of tarif fs on the Energy business will be outsized since we source LFP  battery cells from China.
We are in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP  battery cells in the U.S.
However , the equipment which we have can only service a fraction of our total installed capacity [ later . ] We've also been working on securing additional
supply chain from non-China-based supplies but it will take time.
Also note that Megafactory , irrespective of all the impact on U.S. from energy -- from tarif fs on the Energy business, we do have Megafactory China, which
just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of U.S. There is also an important impact of tarif fs on our capital
investments. I know this is -- will sound counterintuitive since in order to onshore manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring equipment from outside
the U.S. because there is not that much capacity in the U.S. In the current trading environment, such equipment being brought in this objective...
Elon Musk
The expense of bringing it in from China right now .
Vaibhav Taneja
Exactly . And the reality is that China has the basic one which has the most capacity to provide this thing.
Our CapEx guidance inclusive of model tarif fs, even with the optimization we have tried to do, it is forecasted to be still in excess of $10 billion this year .
We're still evaluating what more to do on this. To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tarif fs and brand image.  We think our
strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner , and this is the reason we're still focused on bringing cheaper models
to market soon, with the start of production still planned for June.
Additionally , the advancement in FSD-related features, including pilot robotaxi launch in Austin later this year , should help create a new era of demand. I
would like to thank everyone at Tesla and our customers.
Travis Axelrod
Fantastic. Thank you very much, V aibhav .
Now we will move on to investor questions.
We will start with questions from say .com.
Travis Axelrod
First question is, what are the highest-risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling?
Elon Musk
Sure. W ell, just the -- backed by the -- disambiguate the Cybercab from robotaxi once again.
So the -- when will Teslas because the Teslas that will be fully autonomous in June in Austin are fully Model Ys.
So that is -- it's currently on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously in Austin in June, and then to be in many other cities in the U.S. by the end
of this year .
It's dif ficult to predict the exact ramp sort of week by week and month by month, except that it will ramp up very quickly .
So it's going to be like some -- basically an S-curve where it's very dif ficult to predict the intermediate slope of the S-curve, but you kind of know where the
S-curve is going to end up, which is the vast majority of the Tesla fleet being autonomous.
So that's why I feel confident in predicting large-scale autonomy around the middle of next year , certainly the second half next year , meaning I bet that
there will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously , fully autonomously in the second half of next year , yes.
But it does seem increasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set sort of -- especially for places that have, say , a very snowy weather , like I
say, if you're in the Northeast or something like this -- you can think of -- it's kind of like a human. Like you can be a very good driver in California but are
you going to be also a good driver in a blizzard in Manhattan? You're not going to be as good.
So there is actually some value in -- you can still drive but your probability of an accident is higher .
So the -- it's increasingly obvious that there's some value to having a localized set of parameters for dif ferent regions and localities. But this is -- that put
that in a nice-to-have category . It's not the required category . Really the car is just very much like a human. It's digital neural nets and cameras, and
humans operate with biological neural nets and eyes.
And so the same strengths and weaknesses will be present for digital neural net and cameras versus a biological neural net and eyes.
Ashok, would you like to elaborate on that?
Ashok Elluswamy
Yes. And speaking to the location-specific models, we still have a generalized approach. And you can see that from our deployment of FSD supervised in
China with this very minimal data that's China-specific, the model is generalized quite well to completely dif ferent driving styles. That just like shows that
the AI-based solution that we have is the right one because if you had gone down the previous rule-based solutions, sort of like more hard-coded HD map-
based solutions, it would have taken like many , many years to get China to work.
You can see those in the videos that people post online themselves.
So the generalized solution that we are pursuing is the right one that's going to scale well. And you can think of this like location-specific parameters that
Elon alluded to as a mixture of experts. And if you are sort of familiar with the AI models, Grok and others, they all use this mixture of experts to sort of
specialize the parameters to specific tasks while still being general. This makes the come -- the model to use a limited amount of compute to solve for the [
diversity ] of tasks that it has to solve.
In terms of addressing the question that asked for what are the critical things that need to get right, one thing I would like to note is validation. Self-driving
is a long-tail problem where there can be a lot of edge cases that only happen very , very rarely . Currently , we are driving around in Austin using our QA
fleet, but then super [ rare ] to get interventions that are critical for robotaxi operation.
And so you can go many days without getting a single intervention.
So you can't easily know whether you are improving or regressing in your capacity . And we need to build out sophisticated simulations, including neural
network-based video generation. That's all happening in the background to make sure that we deliver a safe product, and we are able to measure our
safety even though we can't just exceed by driving around the block or something like that.
Elon Musk
I mean in very basic terms, if that -- if we're seeing an accident every 10,000 miles, well, then you have to drive 10,000 miles on average before you get in
an accident or an intervention.
So it's like okay . I mean we must be really -- you don't have to be very worked up by the sheer number of Teslas doing in Austin right now . We like it's
going to look pretty bizarre.
Ashok Elluswamy
Some people are checking at...
Elon Musk
Yes. There's just always a convoy of Teslas going -- just going all over to Austin in circles. But yes, I just can't emphasize this enough. In order to get a
figure on the long-tail things, it's 1 in 10,000, that says 1 in 20,000 miles or 1 in 30,000. The average person drives 10,000 miles in a year .
So not trying to compress that test cycle into a matter of a few months. It means you need a lot of cars doing a lot of driving in order to compress that to do
in a matter of a month what would normally take someone a year .
Ashok Elluswamy
And I would just also add that if you haven't looked at those videos coming out of China, people are...
Elon Musk
Yes, those videos are amazing.
Ashok Elluswamy
Yes, they're putting it to real test. I mean the...
Elon Musk
Frankly , I think the Chinese consumer might be the most American consumer . And let me -- actually , customers in China are awesome. They have a lot of
fun with the cars. I saw one guy take a Tesla on -- autonomously on a narrow dirt road across like a mountain. And I'm like, still a very brave person. And I
said this driving along the road with no barriers where he makes a mistake, he's going to plunge to his doom. But it worked.
Travis Axelrod
And if the question was on Cybercab itself, we're in B-sample validation now .
Elon Musk
Yes, we should ask that question, too.
Lars Moravy
Yes, we have our first -- just like big builds coming at the end of this quarter in Q2. And then in the coming months, we'll start to large scale installation of
all equipment in Giga Texas with -- still on schedule for production next year .
Ashok Elluswamy
Yes. And I just want to also to clarify because I think people don't understand the thing that there's no new building being built and where is Cybercab
going to [indiscernible] in the factory ...
Unknown Executive
Yes. It's happening and people don't know . It's happening [ upstairs ] all the long lines while we're still building the Model Ys and Cybertrucks every day .
Elon Musk
Yes.
So it's worth noting that the Tesla Gigafactory at Austin is 3x the size of the Pentagon.
Unknown Executive
Including the garden.
Elon Musk
Yes, including the ground zero garden.
So Pentagon is like -- its building used to look big, but not anymore.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, when will FSD unsupervised be available for personal use on personally-owned cars?
Elon Musk
Before the end of this year . Not necessarily -- I say within the U.S., like we do want to test -- at Tesla, we're absolutely hardcore about safety . We go to
great lengths to make the safest car in the world and have the lowest accidents per mile in.
So -- and look, fewest lives lost.
So we want to be very careful.
So -- and we want autonomy to be definitively safer than manual driving.
So it's not enough that it just be as safe. It needs to be meaningfully safer than if it's cars manually driven. And we want to confirm that there's not
something -- we just want to be cautious with the rollout. W e don't want to jump in at the deep end with an army .
So with that said, I think we should -- people should -- we should be able to have it work in several cities later this year for personal use.
So the acid test being you should -- can you go to sleep in your car and wait until your destination? And I'm confident that will be available in many cities in
the U.S. by the end of this year .
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, is Tesla still on track for releasing more af fordable models this year? Or will you be focusing on
simplifying versions to enhance af fordability similar to the rear-wheel drive Cybertruck?
Lars Moravy
Yes, we're still planning to release models this year .
As with all launches, we're working through like the last-minute issues that pop up. W e're not getting down one by one. At this point, I would say that ramp
maybe might be a little slower than we had hoped initially , but there's nothing, just kind of given the turmoil that exists in the industry right now . But there's
nothing blocking us from starting production within the next -- within the time line laid out in the opening remarks.
And I will say , it's important to emphasize that as we've said all along, the full utilization of our factories is the primary goal for these new products.
And so flexibility of what we can do within the form factor and the design of it is really limited to what we can do in our existing lines rather than build new
ones. But we've been targeting the low cost of ownership. Monthly payment is the biggest dif ferentiator for our vehicles. And that's why we're focused on
bringing these new models with the big -- the lowest price.
So the market can within the constraints I just highlighted.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, does Tesla see robotaxi as a winner-take-most market? And as you approach the Austin launch, how
do you expect to compare against W aymo's of fering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility?
Elon Musk
Well, okay . The issue with W aymo's cars is it costs way more money , but that is the issue. The car is very expensive, made in low-volume. Teslas are
probably cost 1/4, 20% of what a W aymo costs and made in very high volume. Ironically , like we're the ones who made the bet that a pure AI solution with
cameras and [ already ] what the car actually will listen for sirens and that kind of thing. It's the right move.
And W aymo decided that an expensive sensor suite is the way to go, even though Google is very good at AI.
So I'm wondering. And it is worth noting that Tesla has built an incredible AI software team and AI hardware chip design team from scratch, didn't acquire
anyone. W e just built it.
So yes, it's really -- I mean I don't see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present. I'm sure that will change eventually . But at least as far as I'm
aware, Tesla will have, I don't know , 99% market share or something ridiculous.
That 90-something percent, at least, I don't know , some of them might change, but if we have millions of cars deployed next year and unless others have
millions of cars deployed, like we'll have -- unless we're blocked by regulatory situations, it won't be long. I mean, in a few years, we'll have 10 million
autonomous cars on the roads and counting.
Vaibhav Taneja
The other thing which people forget is that we're not just developing the software solution, we are also manufacturing the cars. And like you know what like
Waymo has, they're taking cars and then trying to...
Elon Musk
Waymo want it.
Vaibhav Taneja
We don't do that, so that definitely gives us a big leg-up. And like Elon said, we only have a big existing fleet which hopefully , with the software update
could become autonomous.
Elon Musk
With the software update, it will become autonomous. To be clear , the Model Y in being autonomous in Austin in June are other Model Ys we make
currently . There's no change to it.
Vaibhav Taneja
I think people don't appreciate that the car which they can buy today ...
Elon Musk
The car that they have...
Vaibhav Taneja
Or the car they have is capable of these kind of things.
Ashok Elluswamy
In fact, it does drive autonomously from the factory to the end of line, every car nowadays.
Unknown Executive
That runs through the tunnel, the Model Y is everything.
Elon Musk
Right. Yes, exactly .
We have -- it has been put to use -- it's doing useful work fully autonomously at the factories, as Ashok was mentioning, the cars drive themselves from
end of line to where they supposed to be picked up by a truck to be taken to the customer . And I'm confident also that later this year , the first Model Y will
drive itself all the way to the customer .
So from our -- probably from a factory in Austin and our one in here in Fremont, California, I'm confident that from both factories, we'll be able to drive
directly to a customer from the factory .
Unknown Executive
Cool delivery .
Elon Musk
Yes, literally goes from the end of line and drive them to your house.
Unknown Executive
It's important to note in the factories, we don't have dedicated lengths or anything. People are coming out every day , trucks delivering supplies, parts,
construction.
Elon Musk
Well, and people can film it. By the way , you can see this from the road like it's not covered. And this many people take videos online. And anyone who
wants to go see it can just drive past our Fremont factory and see the autonomous cars driving themselves. And they drive themselves and they put
themselves in the exact right spot to be picked up.
Unknown Executive
Yes, the logistics yard is right there, the -- they don't move it again to another lane.
Elon Musk
Yes, yes.
So that's just a routine like everyday thing.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, can you please provide an update on the unboxed method and how that has progressed?
Lars Moravy
Sure. It's progressing, absolutely .
As I mentioned just a minute ago, like it is the basis for our Cybercab manufacturing process. It's really what we changed in order to allow the low cost of
production and also get the super high levels of automation. Really levels of automation that are sort of unheard of in the vehicle manufacturing scale. This
is like not something that when you see it be produced, you'll think of in terms of, like, wow , that's how car has been built for 100 years. It's really
something we've changed.
In the past year , we've been like focusing on a lot of key development areas like marrying large subassemblies together in a precise way , in an accurate
way. We've also derisked things like corrosion of uncoated aluminum structures, the ceiling across the seams of the vehicle and when you marry
assemble components. And we've even done early crash testing and improvement that like it's going to be just as safe as the other car was built.
So like we're -- as with all that combined, we kind of go into the builds that we have in this quarter for the Cybercab product, and that's the next real big
test of full-scale integration with the unboxed process. And that's kind of where we are.
So you'll see them on the test roads in a couple of months.
Elon Musk
Yes.
Although the line won't be at this rate initially ...
Lars Moravy
Initially .
Elon Musk
This is a revolutionary production system. I'm not sure what the right word is. Unboxing sounds like something like when you get your phone...
Lars Moravy
And you open it up...
Elon Musk
Yes.
You have like a pleasant experience when you take your phone out of the box, which of course is nice, but this is more revolutionary than that. This is a
profound reimagining of how to make cars in the first place. No car is made like this anywhere in the world. The factory is the product as much as the car
is the product.
So this really just first principles approach to manufacturing that will ultimately allow us, I think, to -- I think, I'm confident ultimately allow us to achieve a
cycle time, meaning a unit every 5 seconds or less, of f a single line.
Lars Moravy
And we want to incorporate some of these for testing into our existing production lines as well to Cybertruck already .
Elon Musk
Yes. I mean this is something I've been thinking about for a long time and I've sort of been thinking about this for a long time. And it's kind of -- it's not a
crazy thing. Like a car every 5 seconds may sound like it's coming out like bullets, but actually it's coming out at walking speed.
Lars Moravy
It's a meter a second.
Elon Musk
A meter a second.
So this is like we're still far away from caring about the aeronomic drag of the manufacturing line because you're still at 3 miles an hour to [indiscernible].
Every 5 seconds sounds crazy . But it's 3 miles an hour that we're talking about.
So yes, you can run away for it basically . But that's still, by far , the fastest line on Earth. And it's like half hour -- what's like the best single line on Earth. not
it's like about...
Unknown Executive
Shanghai Phase 2, 33 seconds...
Elon Musk
And that's us? W e're the fastest, right?
Unknown Executive
Yes. I don't think so...
Elon Musk
We think we're the fastest at 33 seconds in our Shanghai factory , but this would be 6x faster or 7x faster , thereabouts.
So yea, I mean it will be slower than that but the point is that like when you fully optimize the design and operation of the next-generation factory that we're
building right now , a 5-second cycle time or less is, the design is capable of it.
So if you -- when you go through like a radical new architecture, you go from like being like in A -- I mean probably China in particular is an A+ on a
moderately an advanced but still traditional car production system, sort of -- they're really doing about as good as possible to do within in a conventional
scenario.
So trying to get much below , sort of below like 30 seconds, extremely dif ficult.
But -- and you start getting into sort of impossible where you just -- you have to be faster than a human could possibly move.
So then the autonomous line, it really just needs to be robust moving really fast, and that's where you get to sub-5 seconds. But we'll start of f with getting a
C -- instead of an A getting a C on a new architecture, but then the potential is there over time to move them up to an A+, within an A+ architecture.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, how is Tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt to global economic risks and form of tarif fs, political
biases, et cetera?
Vaibhav Taneja
As Elon said, we've been supplying team for a while.
We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tarif fs and political biases by regionalizing part supply near its factories in North America, Berlin and
Shanghai.
For example, in North America, our high-volume vehicle programs have over 85% North America content and Shanghai vehicles have over 95% local
content.
Berlin has similar levels of regionalization as North American when you exclude the battery , and we are working on regionalizing the battery as well. This
is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post pandemic to supply diversification, dual-sourcing, vertical integration, advanced analytics, and local
partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and production stability . Having said that, we are not 100% insulated and these tarif f risks are higher on our
low-volume platforms than the high-volume ones.
Elon Musk
Yes. There's no more vertically integrated car company than Tesla. I mean we're taking -- we're most vertically integrated car companies since Henry Ford
back in the day when they're doing mining iron and stuf f and growing rubber trees.
So -- like we're not growing rubber trees and mining iron yet. But we are -- we have both a lithium refinery in south Texas. And it's -- I mean the biggest
lithium refinery outside of China, I think. Is that right?
Unknown Executive
Yes.
I think so.
Elon Musk
But it has -- its upward potential would be the biggest lithium refinery outside. And we've got strength to expand it and build more, right.
So -- and then we've got the cathode refinery in Austin next to gig factory . We've got to figure out what to do about the anode. This is an ongoing subject of
discussion.
The best of all possible as would be figuring how to have no anode, best part being no part. That's the dream of the batteries to be not having anode. But
either way , we better have the anode, the cathode and the lithium and the electrolytes and the separator to make a cell. But there's no other car company
that has both lithium refineries and cathode refineries. W e're ridiculously vertically integrated, and thus are best positioned to protect against supply chain
disruptions. [indiscernible], you want to talk that progress in...
Unknown Executive
Yes. Certainly , for our in-house cells, we've multi-sourced every component.
We have every path coming from at least 2 dif ferent countries of origin, which is we started this -- the supply chain team and the engineering team worked
together on this for the last couple of years to put that together . It's not something we did in a couple of months. This is years of work.
So we're in a good position to take advantage of that and the in-sourcing of lithium and cathode, they're the 2 most critical parts of the battery that run in
our backyard and we're totally insulated from in operation.
Elon Musk
[indiscernible] operation...
Unknown Executive
We also make our own cells...
Elon Musk
By the way , cell production, if you took this -- you make the anode, the cathode, the lithium, the electrolyte, separator , the can and then you got to put all
that together in the cell factory . And there are entire companies that only do is produce cells but they don't do the other stuf f. They don't refine lithium or
the cathode or -- so our cell production is going quite well. And I think we -- we're currently sort of the lowest cost per kilowatt hour in the...
Unknown Executive
For all cells we purchased in North America. Also cost...
Elon Musk
Yes.
So we have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour , all things considered.
So the Tesla cell is the most competitive cell. Yes, for a kilowatt hour putting to a car . If it's a Tesla cell, it's lower cost than a supplier cell.
Unknown Executive
Yes. And the plan this year is to really build of f that base. Getting to the lowest cost is it's the hardest challenge for the cell manufacturing. It's relatively
easy to build a flashy product that does one thing well to build something at high volume, low cost, it's super dif ficult, and we're kind of using that as a
base to then build of f and add performance in dif ferent areas for new products coming out.
Lars Moravy
I mean, to Elon's point, there's a lot of advantages for regionalization. The most important thing is we're not tying up working capital for 6 to 8 weeks on the
ocean. If there's a design change, then everything that's in transit basically has to be scrapped.
Secondly , port disruptions, as we saw with COVID can be very expensive because slide disconnects can shut down production.
So then your only option is costly or expedite.
It also gives us resilience in supply chain. If one region is down, we can bridge with others. It's more work to set up in the beginning, but it's critical to have
when the need arises. Having said that, it's unrealistic to assume 100% regionalization across the board for specialized areas such as semiconductors. In
such cases, our teams works very closely with our partners to ensure we have strategic banks in place and disruption doesn't impact production while we
stand up the regional manufacturing for that particular commodity .
Unknown Executive
And I'll say like unless the vehicle like you own was talking about with cells, we're also heavily vertically integrated import ingots in turn in castings. W e
recycle those in melt centers, the same thing with plastics, but it doesn't mean we're not exposed. W e do have some areas where we use rare earth
magnets, and we've been working for years to find alternative sources and bring those up as well as we have our induction machines. And as we've
mentioned in the past, we're working on our ferric numbers for some time.
So like as Karn said, with our heavy regionalization percentages, we definitely like the lowest exposed to this, but we're not completely immune as V aibhav
mentioned in his opening remarks.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Similarly related on the battery side, does Tesla still a battery supply constrained as noted on the Q4 call? And does that change with tarif fs?
Karn Budhiraj
This is Karn. W e've been working very hard to expand battery cell production in the U.S., both with vendors and what [ Bonnie ] mentioned earlier with the
4680 program. And we're also working on moving the upstream supply chain for battery cells to the United States for several years. And that strategy is
really starting to pay of f now .
As it stands right now , we're not constrained on battery cell supply for vehicles. The recent tarif fs do pose some challenges to Tesla Energy , well, like our
CFO mentioned earlier , but it's something we've been anticipating and we should be able to resolve in a timely fashion. W e actually have a plan in place,
and we're executing towards it.
We also have some other sources coming online to supplement the shortfall. And then of course, we have the L V production that's happening in-house.
We have a slight disconnect of aligning the right cells with the right path.
So that's the little bit of puzzle that we have to solve internally . But as far as cells go, there's no shortage.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all the rumors of
brand damage?
Unknown Executive
So in Q1, as I mentioned earlier , we took the best-selling car over the last 2 years and ramped up all 4 of our global factories. And in less than 8 weeks,
we've already gone to the rate of our previous Model Ys in the factories.
So just kudos again to the team for the great job there. And despite the economic strain and negative articles, in California in Q1, Tesla remained the best-
selling car , not just EV . And additionally , we had a record number of test drives globally in Q1 as well.
So interest remains high.
And so right now , we continue to see good interest still on vehicle.
Elon Musk
Yes. I mean Tesla is not immune to sort of the macro demand for cars.
So when there is economic uncertainty , people generally want to pause on buying, doing a major capital purchase like a car . But as far as absent macro
issues, we don't see any reduction in demand.
Unknown Executive
Correct. And that's where we continue to focus on af fordability . And it's fun to focus there.
Travis Axelrod
Fantastic. The next question is regarding the Tesla Optimus pilot line, could you confirm if it is currently operational? If so, what is the current production
rate of Optimus bots per week? Additionally , how might the recent tarif fs impact the scalability of this production line moving forward?
Elon Musk
Optimus -- I just want to emphasize Optimus is still very much a development program. It's not a large volume production. This year , we'll make a few --
we do expect to make thousands of Optimus robots, but most of that production is going to be at the end of the year .
So the -- almost everything in Optimus is new . There's not like an existing supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really anything in
the Optimus apart from the AI for Tesla, the Tesla AI computer , which is the same as the one in the car .
So when you have a new complex manufactured product, it will move as fast as the slowest and the least lucky component in the entire thing. And as a
first order approximation, there's like 10,000 unique things.
So that's why anyone who tells you they can predict with precision, the production ramp of the truly new product is -- doesn't know what they're talking
about. It is literally impossible.
So you go through this like a series of constraints where I would think this part is limiting factor and that part is limiting factor , and this part is limiting factor
and multiply that by 1,000, basically . And then the rate of the production ramp is decided by how quickly you can solve each of those problems.
Now Optimus was af fected by the magnet issue from China because the Optimus actuators in the arm to use permanent magnet.
Now Tesla, as a whole, does not need to use permanent magnets. But when something is volume constrained like an arm of the robot, then you want to
try to make the motor as small as possible.
And then -- so we did design in permanent magnets for those motors and those were af fected by the supply chain by basically China requiring an export
license to send out any rare earth magnets.
So we're working through that with China. Hopefully , we'll get a license to use the rare earth magnets.
China wants some assurances that these are not used for military purposes, which obviously they're not. They're just going into a humanoid robot.
So -- and it's a nonweapon system. But that is an example of a challenge there. I'm confident we'll overcome these issues. And we'll, by the end of this
year, have thousands of Optimus robots.
Travis Axelrod
Great. Thank you very much. And the last question, we already covered earlier , whether robotaxi was still on track for this year .
So with that, we can move on to analyst questions.
The first question is going to come from Pierre at New Street.
Pierre Ferragu
Guys, can you hear me?
Travis Axelrod
Yes.
Pierre Ferragu
That's great. I'm super excited to hear robotaxi and Optimus becoming the very tangible future for Tesla. But I have actually a question on the legacy , not
legacy , in the current like Auto business. And when I look back to the ramp of Model 3 a few years ago, I really saw it as being the iPhone of cars, a new
product, completely reinvented, very dif ferent user experience, vastly superior , impossible to match for traditional competitors.
And for the iPhone, which resulted in the high end of the smartphone market quadrupling in size and actually Apple taking 60% market share.
And so when you look at the Model 3 and the Model Y today , I think they are still actually vastly superior to any other cars. And I wonder why they've taken
about 15% of their addressable market and not more actually? So another way to put it is, why are there so many people still buying BMW and Mercedes,
knowing that Model 3 and the Model Ys are out there and available?
And I wonder if you're trying to solve that [ really ] internally .
If you understand why -- what are these auto buyers who are not buying a Model 3 or Model Y missing. And if you have ideas of things you could do to
address that. Maybe there is enormous value left on the table there. Yes, that's what I'm wondering these days.
Elon Musk
Yes. The reality is that in the future, most people are not going to buy cars.
So it's kind of a -- one could sort of say , look, if you want to continue with your phone metaphor , I mean, you can remember the days of the flip-phones
when there was 100 dif ferent flip-phone designs. And I would -- the mistake that lump manufacturers made was to try to make many dif ferent variants of
flip phone, which was a mistake. They should have made the iPhone.
So -- because, obviously , everyone is going to want a smartphone. But in the beginning of when the iPhone came out, I was like, wow , I can't believe
these guys as not reacting as though this is death. But they kept making the variants of flip phones. Nokia, I think at one point, it was the most valuable
company in the world or close to it. But they kept making flip phones. Trying to find another market niche, maybe somebody wants forward of a dif ferent
style. I mean this dif ferent color or whatever it is.
No. They just want a super intelligent phone that can do everything, just one.
So I said this many years ago, in the future, in the not-too-distant future, buying a gasoline car that is not autonomous will be like riding a horse while using
a flip phone.
Some people still do it, but it's rare.
Travis Axelrod
Great. The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner at W olfe.
Emmanuel Rosner
So Elon, the public version of the FSD software still has a decent amount of, I guess, intermittent human interventions that are required.
So what's still required for the software on your end to get to a level where it doesn't need to be supervised? And I'm asking that in the context of
obviously , the June launch being in the next couple of months. What still needs to happen?
Ashok Elluswamy
And we are working on a number of items, too. Yes. I mean we are aware of the interventions that are happening in the public bills, and that's why we are
hardcore burning it down. And really speaking, some initial city helped us focus on like solving all the issues that we face here for example, like is focusing
on Austin.
We are not like solving all the issues that customers in Boston or somewhere else might face.
And then here, we just have like a big list of all the issues, just burn it down and that's what the team is working on, along with other sort of like
redundancy issues.
For example, if one of the computer goes down, right on the customer fleet, it would like throw the [ red hands ] and ask you to take over , but we don't
want that kind of situation.
So you're solving both like the reliability issues of the autonomy software and also the reliability issues of the system software together for Austin.
Elon Musk
Yes. It really just -- we just work through a long tail of unusual interventions.
So -- and these are really very rare, intervention every 10,000 miles. I mean that's a lot of driving you've got to do to even find one case...
Ashok Elluswamy
Yes.
And some interventions systematic missing functionality , for example, for handling emergency vehicles currently , you don't need to consume audio as an
input but then the customer-facing versions don't have audio input. But the version that's in -- that's going to be in Austin will have audio input and so on.
Emmanuel Rosner
Okay . But would you have like remote operators, for example?
Ashok Elluswamy
I mean every now and then, if a car gets stuck or something, someone will like unlock it. But it's just because we are a bit conservative and tend towards
more safety than even if we get stuck every now and then, we do have remote support. But it's not going to be required for safe operation. If anything, it's
just required for more availability .
Elon Musk
Anyway , it's only a couple of months away .
So you're going to see it for yourself in a couple of months in Austin.
Travis Axelrod
Great.
Our next question comes from Edison at Deutsche Bank.
Xin Yu
So I wanted to ask about the Optimus supply chain going forward.
You mentioned a very fast ramp-up. What do you envision that supply chain looking like? Is it going to require many more suppliers to be in the U.S. now
because of the tarif fs? How does one kind of think about what needs to happen there?
Elon Musk
We'll have to see how things settle out. I don't know yet. I mean some things we're doing, as we've already talked about, which is that we've already taken
tremendous steps to localize our supply chain. W e're more localized than any other manufacturer . And we have a lot of things kind of underway that to
increase the localization to reduce supply chain risk associated with geopolitical uncertainty . Did you have a follow-up, Edison?
Xin Yu
Yes. W anted to come back actually to the robotaxi then. Do you have a sense on how many cars or how big the scale will be initially and how that might
ramp up? I know you're targeting millions of vehicles in the second half kind of next year . But initially at launch, how many vehicles would be reasonable?
And is it going to be as simple as if one goes to Austin, let's say in late June or July , you'll be able to request?
Elon Musk
Yes. W e're still debating the exact number to start up on day 1, but it's, I don't know , maybe 10 or 20 vehicles on day 1. And watch it carefully to scale it up
rapidly after that.
So we want to make sure that we're paying very close attention to the first time this happens. But yes, end of June or July , just go to Austin and order a
Tesla autonomous drive.
Travis Axelrod
Great. The next question comes from George at Canaccord.
George Gianarikas
It has to do with FSD pricing. Can we envision when you launch unsupervised FSD that there could be sort of a multitiered pricing approach to
unsupervised versus supervised similar to what you did with autopilot versus FSD in the past?
Vaibhav Taneja
I mean this is something which we've been thinking about. I mean just so now for people who have been trying FSD and who've been using FSD, they
think given the current pricing is too cheap because for $99, basically getting a personal shop.
Elon Musk
Yes. I mean we do need to give people more time to -- if they want to look at -- like a key breakpoint is, can you read your text messages or not? Can you
write a text message or not? Because obviously , people are doing this, by the way , with unautonomous cars all the time. And if you just go over and drive
down the highway and you'll see people texting while driving doing 80-mile an hour .
Vaibhav Taneja
And putting makeup on at the same time...
Elon Musk
Yes. Putting on makeup, doing their hair with the mirror down and texting and driving at 80 miles an hour . This is a common occurrence.
So people eating lunch, you name it, shaving.
So anyway , but right now , the car is very consistent that you pay attention to the road, which reduces the value somewhat because it's very rigorous about
you paying attention to the road. And we'll gradually lighten up on that every few weeks or every month, we'll relax that a little bit and make it so you can
be more and more able to do things you want to do and not have the car demand your attention.
So that value -- it will really be profound when you can basically do whatever you want, including sleep. And then that $99 is going to seem like the best
$99 you ever spent in your life.
Travis Axelrod
And George, do you have a follow-up?
George Gianarikas
My follow-up is about geographic expansion.
Just maybe discuss additional markets. There's been some news around India recently that you could launch this year and next.
Ashok Elluswamy
So yes, I mean, we've been working on getting into India. India is a very hot market. And especially the current -- and I don't want to talk just about tarif fs,
but the current tarif f structure with India is that any car which we send in is subject to 70% tarif f, also like a 30% luxury tax on it.
So the same car which we're sending is like 100% more expensive than what it has.
So that creates a lot of anxiety is like people feel, okay , they're paying too much for the car . And by the way , we're not getting the money . The local
government is getting the money . And that's why we've been very careful trying to figure out when is the right time. W e -- like I said, we are working on it.
It's a -- it would be a great market to enter because India has a big middle class, which we would want to tap in and that is the market which we want to be
in. But again, these kind of things create a little bit of tension which we're trying to work around.
Travis Axelrod
Great. The next question comes from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley .
We can't hear you, Adam.
So maybe we'll put you back in the queue and we'll move to Colin Langan from W ells Fargo while Adam figures out his audio.
Colin Langan
Do you hear me?
Travis Axelrod
Yes.
Colin Langan
You're still sticking with the vision-only approach. A lot of autonomous people still have a lot of concerns about sun glare, fog and dust. Any color on how
you anticipate on getting around those issues? Because my understanding, it kind of blinds the camera when you get glare and stuf f.
Elon Musk
Actually , it does not blind the camera. W e use an approach which is a direct photon count.
So when you see a processed image, so the image that goes from the -- with sort of photon counter , the silicon photon counter , that they get -- goes
through a digital signal processor or image signal processor . That's normally what happens. And then the image that you see looks all washed out
because if it's -- you pointed a camera at the sun, the post-processing of the photon counting washes things out. It actually adds noise.
So quite a big breakthrough that we made some time ago was to go with direct photon counting and bypass the image signal processor . And then you can
drive pretty much straight at the sun, and you can also see in what appears to be the blackest of night. And then here in fog, we can see as well as people
can, probably better , but in fact probably slightly better than people than the average person anyway .
Colin Langan
So the camera is able to see when there's direct glare on it?
Elon Musk
Yes.
Colin Langan
Okay . And then just there are obviously media reports the other day that the af fordable model was delayed. It doesn't sound like that's correct. Those
reports also talked about it being more of a cheaper version of the Model Y. Any color on what we should expect? Is it a cheaper version of the Model Y?
Or is it actually going to be a design change with it?
Ashok Elluswamy
So I think Lars only covered it in answering one of the say .com questions. The real thing which we are trying to focus on is the af fordability . And using our
existing lines, and there's always limitations when you're using the existing lines as to how many dif ferent form factors can you bring to it.
So that's the way I would say you should think about it. And I don't know if, Lars, anything more to add?
Lars Moravy
Yes.
I think I said this before in the call, like with the recent upgrades to the Model 3 and the Model Y platforms, we need some pretty great cars at pretty big
prices and we added a bunch of features and things like that.
I think it's easy to consider that moving forward, Tesla doesn't make bad cars, and we always make -- our intent is not to make a car that is any worse than
any car we've ever produced in the past.
And so the models that come out in the next month will be built on our lines and will resemble form and shape the cars we currently make. And the key is
that they'll be af fordable and they'll be able to buy one.
Travis Axelrod
Great. W e might have time for one last question. Adam, we'll try your audio again. Do you want to try to unmute yourself, Adam? All right. Unfortunately ,
still not working -- there you go. Go ahead, Adam.
Adam Jonas
Yes, in the February 28 Joe Rogan interview , Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tarif fs to give people time to adjust. Otherwise, you said, "The system
would break and bad things would happen." So are things breaking yet? And if the announced -- if the tarif fs as announced remain in place, when would
things start breaking?
Elon Musk
Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I'm not -- I'm one of many advisers to the President, I'm not the President. But I've made my opinion clear to the
President and that -- and other people made their opinion clear to the President. He talks to many people and he makes his decision. And I'm hopeful that
the President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions of others and perhaps where he might advise dif ferently in the
future, which we'll see.
But I'm an advocate of predictable tarif f structures and generally I'm an advocate for free trade and lower tarif fs.
Now one does need to take a look at where -- if some country is doing something predatory with tarif fs or is providing extreme support for -- if a
government is providing extreme financial support for a particular industry , then we have to do something to counteract that. But I think that's on a case-
by-case basis strategically . But the President is the elected representative of the people and is fully within his rights to do what he would like to do.
Adam Jonas
Okay . Elon, I respect that.
Just as a follow-up, between China and United States, who, in your opinion, is further ahead on the development of physical AI, specifically on humanoid
and also drones? I'd be interested. And is it even close and kind of how?
Elon Musk
I mean a friend of mine posted on X, I reposted it.
I think of a prophetic statement, which is any country that cannot manufacture its own drones is doing to be the vast state of any country that can. And we
can't -- America cannot currently manufacture its own drones.
Let that sink in, unfortunately .
So China, I believe manufactures about 70% of all drones. And if you look at the total supply chain, China is almost 100% of drones are -- have a supply
chain dependency on China.
So China is in a very strong position. And here in America, we need to tip more of our people and resources to manufacturing because this is -- and I have
a lot of respect for China because I think China is amazing, actually . But the United States does not have such a severe dependency on China for drones
and be unable to make them unless China gives us the parts, which is currently the situation.
With respect to humanoid robots, I don't think there's any company and any country that can match as well. Tesla and SpaceX are #1. And then I'm a little
concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks 2 through 10 will be Chinese companies. I'm confident that rank 1 will be Tesla.
Travis Axelrod
Great. W ell, I think that's unfortunately all the time we have for today . We appreciate all your questions and look forward to talking to you next quarter .
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
