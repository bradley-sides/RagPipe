Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Steve,
 
and
 
thanks
 
to
 
everyone
 
joining
 
us
 
today.
 
We
 
completed
 
2024
 
with
 
an
 
all-time
 
high
 
of
 
$83
 
million
 
in
 
revenue
 
despite
 
a
 
semiconductor
 
slowdown
 
throughout
 
the
 
year
 
in
 
which
 
most
 
of
 
our
 
larger
 
power
 
semiconductor
 
peers
 
saw
 
declining
 
revenues.
 
While
 
our
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
business
 
was
 
impacted
 
by
 
the
 
slowdown
 
in
 
solar,
 
industrial,
 
and
 
EV,
 
our
 
GaN
 
business
 
grew
 
over
 
50%
 
in
 
2024
 
to
 
an
 
all-time
 
high
 
with
 
revenues
 
coming
 
from
 
mobile,
 
consumer
 
appliances
 
and
 
the
 
initial
 
ramp-up
 
of
 
data
 
centers.
 
We
 
also
 
completed
 
2024
 
with
 
an
 
extraordinary
 
$450
 
million
 
of
 
design
 
wins,
 
which
 
reﬂects
 
the
 
lifetime
 
revenues
 
of
 
new
 
customer
 
programs
 
in
 
which
 
Navitas
 
products
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
ramp
 
to
 
revenues
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
few
 
years.
 
This
 
design
 
win
 
total
 
represents
 
a
 
win
 
rate
 
of
 
over
 
50%
 
and
 
gives
 
us
 
increased
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
and
 
visibility
 
to
 
expected
 
growth
 
as
 
we
 
look
 
into
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025
 
and
 
'26.
 
I'm
 
also
 
pleased
 
with
 
our
 
total
 
customer
 
pipeline
 
growth,
 
which
 
has
 
nearly
 
doubled
 
from
 
$1.25
 
billion
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2023
 
to
 
$2.4
 
billion
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
'24,
 
reﬂecting
 
strong
 
expected
 
expansion
 
in
 
our
 
major
 
markets.
 
Let
 
me
 
share
 
some
 
speciﬁcs
 
in
 
each.
 
Our
 
data
 
center
 
sector
 
has
 
the
 
highest
 
growth
 
rates
 
in
 
revenue
 
and
 
design
 
wins
 
with
 
40
 
customer
 
project
 
wins
 
throughout
 
the
 
year.
 
These
 
wins
 
were
 
at
 
top
 
ODMs
 
in
 
Asia
 
that
 
target
 
major
 
Tier
 
1
 
data
 
center
 
players
 
such
 
as
 
Google,
 
Amazon,
 
Facebook,
 
Alibaba,
 
Dell,
 
HP,
 
and
 
others.
 
Our
 
system
 
reference
 
designs
 
that
 
span
 
from
 
2.7
 
kilowatts
 
to
 
8.5
 
kilowatts
 
were
 
key
 
enablers
 
for
 
this
 
new
 
business
 
as
 
we
 
showcase
 
to
 
customers
 
the
 
extraordinary
 
energy
 
eﬃciency
 
and
 
power
 
density
 
that
 
is
 
possible,
 
particularly
 
when
 
combining
 
our
 
GeneSiC
 
technology
 
in
 
the
 
PFC
 
circuit
 
and
 
our
 
GaNSafe
 
technology
 
in
 
the
 
LLC
 
circuits
 
for
 
these
 
AC
 
to
 
DC
 
power
 
supply
 
units.
 
Also,
 
we
 
view
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
lower-cost
 
AI
 
platforms
 
such
 
as
 
Deepseq
 
as
 
a
 
positive
 
development
 
that
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
drive
 
a
 
lower
 
cost
 
of
 
AI
 
implementations,
 
which
 
can
 
accelerate
 
AI
 
adoption,
 
both
 
in
 
the
 
cloud
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
edge,
 
potentially
 
translating
 
to
 
greater
 
overall
 
demand
 
for
 
power
 
and
 
for
 
Navitas
 
technology.
 
Our
 
data
 
center
 
customer
 
pipeline
 
has
 
more
 
than
 
doubled
 
to
 
over
 
$165
 
million
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
$70
 
million
 
the
 
year
 
prior.
 
As
 
announced
 
last
 
quarter,
 
we
 
have
 
started
 
sampling
 
our
 
80-
 
to
 
120-volt
 
family
 
of
 
GaN
 
devices,
 
targeting
 
48-volt
 
DC-to-DC
 
converters
 
in
 
data
 
centers
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
48-volt
 
EV
 
battery
 
systems
 
and
 
48-volt
 
robots
 
in
 
the
 
longer
 
term.
 
We
 
expect
 
growing
 
customer
 
demand
 
activity
 
throughout
 
2025
 
and
 
ﬁrst
 
appreciable
 
revenues
 
next
 
year.
 
In
 
the
 
EV
 
space,
 
we
 
are
 
happy
 
to
 
announce
 
over
 
40
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
2024
 
across
 
Europe,
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
China,
 
and
 
Korea,
 
heavily
 
focused
 
on
 
onboard
 
chargers
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
roadside
 
chargers.
 
We're
 
also
 
excited
 
to
 
announce
 
what
 
we
 
believe
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
industry's
 
ﬁrst
 
GaN
 
design
 
win
 
into
 
any
 
electric
 
vehicle.
 
China's
 
#3
 
EV
 
player,
 
Changan,
 
has
 
selected
 
Navitas
 
GaNSafe
 
technology
 
to
 
power
 
their
 
next-generation
 
EV
 
onboard
 
chargers,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
achieved
 
extraordinary
 
power
 
densities
 
of
 
6
 
kilowatts
 
per
 
liter
 
and
 
energy
 
eﬃciencies
 
of
 
96%.
 
Changan
 
estimates
 
that
 
these
 
GaNSafe-powered
 
onboard
 
chargers
 
could
 
extend
 
lifetime
 
driving
 
range
 
by
 
10,000
 
kilometers
 
and
 
could
 
reduce
 
charging
 
costs
 
by
 
15%
 
to
 
20%.
 
We
 
expect
 
this
 
project
 
and
 
other
 
GaN
 
EV
 
projects
 
to
 
start
 
production
 
ramp
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
half
 
of
 
2026.
 
Our
 
EV
 
pipeline
 
has
 
expanded
 
rapidly
 
to
 
over
 
$900
 
million
 
compared
 
to
 
$400
 
million
 
a
 
year
 
ago
 
and
 
now
 
represents
 
nearly
 
40%
 
of
 
our
 
$2.4
 
billion
 
pipeline.
 
In
 
the
 
mobile
 
sector,
 
we
 
have
 
enabled
 
very
 
broad
 
expansion
 
in
 
the
 
adoption
 
of
 
GaN
 
chargers
 
with
 
over
 
180
 
design
 
wins.
 
This
 
includes
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
signiﬁcant
 
wins
 
with
 
Transsion,
 
now
 
a
 
top
 
5
 
global
 
smartphone
 
player
 
and
 
the
 
leader
 
in
 
markets
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
Middle
 
East,
 
Africa,
 
and
 
Central
 
and
 
South
 
America.
 
We
 
also
 
had
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
wins
 
in
 
India
 
with
 
Jio,
 
a
 
leader
 
in
 
consumer
 
networking,
 
who
 
selected
 
Navitas
 
GaN
 
ICs
 
to
 
power
 
their
 
next-generation
 
Wi-Fi
 
equipment.
 
We
 
expect
 
both
 
of
 
these
 
new
 
customers
 
will
 
reﬂect
 
multiple
 
million-dollar
 
projects
 
ramping
 
in
 
late
 
'25,
 
demonstrating
 
greater
 
mainstream
 
adoption
 
of
 
GaN
 
chargers
 
expanding
 
into
 
these
 
lower-cost
 
regions.
 
We
 
now
 
estimate
 
that
 
GaN
 
chargers
 
will
 
reach
 
over
 
10%
 
adoption
 
rate
 
of
 
all
 
mobile
 
chargers
 
to
 
power
 
smartphones,
 
tablets,
 
and
 
laptops
 
in
 
2025
 
as
 
the
 
average
 
power
 
of
 
these
 
chargers
 
approaches
 
45
 
watts.
 
This
 
power
 
increase
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
trend
 
to
 
not
 
only
 
support
 
faster
 
charging
 
for
 
all
 
consumers,
 
but
 
also
 
our
 
GaN
 
value
 
increases
 
as
 
that
 
power
 
level
 
increases,
 
delivering
 
the
 
maximum
 
power
 
at
 
the
 
highest
 
eﬃciencies
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
smallest
 
size
 
and
 
weight
 
for
 
these
 
wall
 
adapters.
 
Navitas
 
continues
 
to
 
supply
 
10
 
of
 
the
 
top
 
10
 
mobile
 
players
 
designing
 
with
 
Navitas
 
GaN
 
IC
 
technology.
 
In
 
the
 
solar
 
space,
 
we
 
are
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
a
 
major
 
launch
 
this
 
summer
 
with
 
the
 
leader
 
in
 
microinverters
 
to
 
begin
 
an
 
important
 
and
 
signiﬁcant
 
transition
 
from
 
silicon
 
to
 
GaN,
 
enabling
 
a
 
new
 
wave
 
of
 
energy
 
eﬃciency,
 
power
 
density
 
and
 
size,
 
weight
 
and
 
cost
 
reductions
 
for
 
the
 
solar
 
industry.
 
We
 
see
 
microinverters
 
becoming
 
the
 
leading
 
residential
 
solar
 
solution
 
and
 
many
 
other
 
players
 
in
 
this
 
space
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
pursue
 
a
 
similar
 
transition
 
from
 
silicon
 
to
 
GaN.
 
Across
 
the
 
solar,
 
energy
 
storage,
 
industrial,
 
and
 
appliance
 
sectors,
 
we
 
enjoyed
 
over
 
170
 
customer
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
2024,
 
which
 
we
 
expect
 
will
 
fuel
 
important
 
growth
 
in
 
2026
 
and
 
beyond.
 
I'm
 
excited
 
to
 
share
 
our
 
plans
 
for
 
a
 
major
 
technology
 
announcement
 
coming
 
up
 
on
 
March
 
12.
 
This
 
will
 
be
 
our
 
ﬁrst-ever
 
global
 
online
 
launch
 
event.
 
While
 
the
 
details
 
won't
 
be
 
disclosed
 
until
 
that
 
event,
 
we
 
believe
 
this
 
announcement
 
will
 
usher
 
in
 
a
 
new
 
era
 
for
 
power
 
electronics
 
and
 
accelerate
 
gallium
 
nitride
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
in
 
major
 
multibillion-dollar
 
markets.
 
We
 
hope
 
you
 
will
 
all
 
join
 
us
 
for
 
this
 
exciting
 
event.
 
Finally,
 
looking
 
towards
 
2025,
 
we
 
expect
 
a
 
Q1
 
revenue
 
decline,
 
reﬂecting
 
normal
 
mobile
 
seasonality,
 
coupled
 
with
 
continued
 
end-market
 
weakness
 
and
 
some
 
remaining
 
inventory
 
correction
 
in
 
the
 
solar,
 
industrial,
 
and
 
EV
 
markets.
 
We
 
expect
 
a
 
modest
 
recovery
 
in
 
Q2
 
and
 
anticipate
 
returning
 
to
 
healthy
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
fueled
 
by
 
our
 
$450
 
million
 
of
 
design
 
wins
 
last
 
year
 
and
 
the
 
expected
 
start
 
of
 
a
 
semiconductor
 
recovery.
 
Now
 
let
 
me
 
turn
 
it
 
over
 
to
 
Todd
 
Glickman,
 
our
 
CFO,
 
to
 
cover
 
the
 
ﬁnancials
 
in
 
greater
 
detail.
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Gene.
 
In
 
my
 
comments
 
today,
 
I
 
will
 
ﬁrst
 
take
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
and
 
annual
 
2024
 
ﬁnancial
 
results,
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
our
 
outlook
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter,
 
along
 
with
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
market
 
dynamics
 
we
 
are
 
currently
 
seeing.
 
Revenue
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024
 
was
 
within
 
guidance
 
at
 
$18
 
million.
 
As
 
expected,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
sequential
 
decline
 
was
 
in
 
the
 
mobile
 
and
 
consumer
 
markets.
 
The
 
decline
 
compared
 
to
 
a
 
year
 
ago
 
quarter
 
was
 
primarily
 
the
 
result
 
of
 
lower
 
revenues
 
in
 
the
 
EV,
 
solar,
 
and
 
industrial
 
markets.
 
For
 
the
 
full
 
year
 
of
 
2024,
 
we
 
grew
 
revenue
 
to
 
$83.3
 
million,
 
or
 
5%
 
from
 
$79.5
 
million
 
in
 
2023.
 
Our
 
GaN
 
revenue
 
grew
 
more
 
than
 
50%
 
for
 
the
 
full
 
year
 
and
 
reached
 
an
 
all-time
 
high
 
as
 
aggressive
 
adoption
 
of
 
GaN
 
to
 
replace
 
silicon
 
continued
 
in
 
the
 
mobile,
 
consumer,
 
and
 
appliance
 
segments,
 
with
 
data
 
center
 
revenues
 
starting
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
Before
 
addressing
 
gross
 
proﬁt
 
and
 
expenses,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
you
 
to
 
the
 
GAAP
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
reconciliations
 
in
 
our
 
press
 
release
 
earlier
 
today.
 
In
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
my
 
commentary,
 
I
 
will
 
refer
 
to
 
non-GAAP
 
measures.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
was
 
40.2%,
 
which
 
was
 
relatively
 
ﬂat
 
sequentially
 
compared
 
to
 
40.1%
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter.
 
For
 
the
 
ﬁscal
 
year
 
2024,
 
the
 
non-GAAP
 
gross
 
margin
 
was
 
40.4%
 
compared
 
to
 
41.8%
 
in
 
2023,
 
primarily
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
less
 
favorable
 
market
 
mix.
 
In
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter,
 
we
 
executed
 
expense
 
management
 
initiatives
 
and
 
reduced
 
operating
 
expenses
 
sequentially
 
to
 
$19.9
 
million,
 
comprised
 
of
 
SG&A
 
expenses
 
of
 
$8
 
million
 
and
 
R&D
 
expenses
 
of
 
$11.9
 
million.
 
This
 
demonstrates
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
balance
 
operational
 
eﬃciency
 
while
 
we
 
continue
 
investing
 
in
 
next-generation
 
GaN
 
and
 
SiC
 
technology
 
and
 
in
 
market
 
development,
 
primarily
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
center,
 
EV,
 
and
 
mobile
 
sectors.
 
For
 
ﬁscal
 
year
 
2024,
 
non-GAAP
 
operating
 
expenses
 
were
 
$83.4
 
million
 
compared
 
to
 
$73.5
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
prior
 
year.
 
Adding
 
all
 
this
 
together,
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
2024
 
loss
 
from
 
operations
 
was
 
$12.7
 
million,
 
ﬂat
 
sequentially
 
as
 
cost
 
reductions
 
oﬀset
 
the
 
quarter-over-quarter
 
revenue
 
decline
 
and
 
a
 
loss
 
of
 
$49.7
 
million
 
for
 
the
 
full
 
year
 
compared
 
to
 
a
 
loss
 
of
 
$40.3
 
million
 
for
 
2023.
 
Our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
was
 
187
 
million
 
shares.
 
Turning
 
to
 
the
 
balance
 
sheet.
 
In
 
Q4,
 
the
 
company
 
disengaged
 
with
 
a
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
distributor,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
one-time
 
$11.6
 
million
 
expense
 
related
 
to
 
an
 
inventory
 
reserve
 
and
 
bad
 
debt.
 
Accounts
 
receivable
 
sequentially
 
declined
 
to
 
approximately
 
$14
 
million
 
from
 
$26
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
prior
 
quarter.
 
And
 
inventory
 
fell
 
to
 
$15.5
 
million
 
from
 
$21.3
 
million,
 
in
 
turn,
 
reducing
 
our
 
days
 
of
 
inventory
 
to
 
130,
 
down
 
from
 
147.
 
Our
 
balance
 
sheet
 
remains
 
very
 
strong
 
as
 
we
 
enter
 
2025
 
with
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
liquidity
 
and
 
an
 
improved
 
working
 
capital
 
position.
 
Cash
 
and
 
cash
 
equivalents
 
at
 
quarter
 
end
 
were
 
$87
 
million,
 
and
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
carry
 
no
 
debt.
 
Moving
 
on
 
to
 
guidance
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter.
 
We
 
currently
 
expect
 
revenues
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
$13
 
million
 
to
 
$15
 
million,
 
reﬂecting
 
greater
 
than
 
typical
 
seasonality
 
given
 
continued
 
softness
 
and
 
remaining
 
inventory
 
corrections
 
in
 
solar,
 
EV,
 
and
 
industrial
 
end
 
markets.
 
Overall,
 
while
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
forecast
 
a
 
more
 
muted
 
ﬁrst
 
half
 
of
 
2025,
 
we
 
anticipate
 
growth
 
to
 
resume
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half,
 
fueled
 
by
 
2024
 
design
 
wins
 
and
 
expected
 
recovery
 
in
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
our
 
end
 
markets.
 
Gross
 
margin
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
slightly
 
lower
 
than
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
with
 
our
 
guidance
 
at
 
38%,
 
plus
 
or
 
minus
 
50
 
basis
 
points
 
as
 
our
 
expected
 
mix
 
continues
 
to
 
lean
 
toward
 
the
 
mobile
 
market
 
in
 
the
 
near
 
term.
 
We
 
expect
 
modest
 
margin
 
improvement
 
throughout
 
the
 
year,
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
growth
 
anticipated
 
in
 
our
 
higher
 
power
 
markets.
 
Turning
 
to
 
operating
 
expenses.
 
We
 
have
 
completed
 
some
 
additional
 
workforce
 
reductions
 
and
 
are
 
realizing
 
further
 
synergies
 
and
 
operational
 
eﬃciencies
 
associated
 
with
 
prior
 
acquisitions,
 
all
 
of
 
which
 
align
 
our
 
cost
 
structure
 
with
 
revenue
 
expectations.
 
By
 
consolidating
 
certain
 
support
 
and
 
engineering
 
functions
 
and
 
sites
 
and
 
further
 
streamlining
 
the
 
company,
 
we
 
anticipate
 
a
 
reduction
 
of
 
our
 
ﬁrst-quarter
 
operating
 
expenses
 
to
 
$18
 
million
 
and
 
approximately
 
$15.5
 
million
 
per
 
quarter
 
thereafter.
 
Combining
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
cost
 
reduction
 
and
 
eﬃciency
 
improvements
 
with
 
our
 
strong
 
cash
 
position,
 
clean
 
balance
 
sheet
 
and
 
growth
 
outlook
 
ﬁrmly
 
positions
 
the
 
company
 
to
 
reach
 
expected
 
positive
 
EBITDA
 
in
 
2026.
 
For
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025,
 
we
 
expect
 
our
 
weighted
 
average
 
share
 
count
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
190
 
million
 
shares.
 
In
 
closing,
 
while
 
we
 
are
 
thoughtfully
 
navigating
 
the
 
near-term
 
softness
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
end
 
markets,
 
our
 
substantial
 
customer
 
pipeline
 
and
 
design
 
wins
 
and
 
ever-increasing
 
technology
 
lead
 
puts
 
us
 
in
 
a
 
strong
 
position
 
to
 
scale
 
to
 
proﬁtability
 
as
 
we
 
enable
 
the
 
next
 
generation
 
of
 
power
 
electronics.
 
Operator,
 
let's
 
begin
 
the
 
Q&A
 
session.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
question.
 
This
 
is
 
coming
 
from
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
from
 
Deutsche
 
Bank.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
Gene,
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
talk
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
where
 
you
 
think
 
the
 
cyclical
 
bottom
 
is.
 
I
 
know
 
seasonality
 
plays
 
a
 
big
 
part
 
in
 
the
 
March
 
quarter
 
overall
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
your
 
more
 
consumer
 
and
 
mobile
 
areas.
 
But
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
the
 
cyclical
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
equation
 
has
 
found
 
the
 
bottom
 
now?
 
And
 
if
 
so,
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
view
 
the
 
slope
 
of
 
the
 
recovery?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Good
 
question,
 
Ross.
 
Certainly,
 
Q1,
 
by
 
all
 
measures,
 
looks
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
cyclical
 
bottom,
 
at
 
least
 
from
 
a
 
Navitas
 
perspective.
 
Obviously,
 
we're
 
a
 
smaller
 
player.
 
We
 
have
 
maybe
 
diﬀerent
 
market
 
dynamics
 
on
 
where
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
are
 
being
 
adopted.
 
Industrial
 
still
 
seems
 
pretty
 
sluggish.
 
Solar,
 
we're
 
a
 
little
 
more
 
bullish
 
on,
 
especially
 
as
 
the
 
GaN
 
adoption
 
starts
 
middle
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
EV
 
is
 
probably
 
where
 
we've
 
seen
 
the
 
best
 
pickup
 
starting
 
in
 
China.
 
I
 
think
 
others
 
have
 
observed
 
the
 
same.
 
And
 
we're
 
more
 
bullish
 
there,
 
too,
 
because
 
we've
 
just
 
got
 
such
 
a
 
strong
 
pipeline
 
in
 
onboard
 
chargers,
 
in
 
particular,
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
and
 
GaN
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
roadside
 
chargers,
 
which
 
are
 
all
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
and
 
brand-new
 
modules
 
we
 
introduced.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
all
 
of
 
those
 
are
 
sort
 
of
 
at
 
play.
 
From
 
our
 
perspective,
 
the
 
cyclical
 
bottom
 
certainly
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
Q1,
 
but
 
we
 
see
 
the
 
recovery
 
starting
 
in
 
Q2
 
and
 
a
 
nice
 
healthy
 
growth
 
outlook
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
half.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
And
 
I
 
guess
 
as
 
my
 
follow-up,
 
you
 
talked
 
about
 
the
 
strength
 
of
 
the
 
GaN
 
business
 
growing
 
over
 
50%
 
last
 
year.
 
And
 
I'm
 
not
 
asking
 
you
 
for
 
speciﬁc
 
numbers
 
on
 
the
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
side
 
of
 
things,
 
but
 
how
 
are
 
you
 
viewing
 
that
 
market?
 
Was
 
it
 
in
 
your
 
mind
 
just
 
weaker
 
because
 
the
 
end
 
market
 
was
 
weak,
 
inventory
 
burn,
 
et
 
cetera?
 
And
 
we've
 
heard
 
that
 
from
 
many,
 
many
 
players.
 
Or
 
was
 
there
 
something
 
a
 
little
 
more
 
Navitas
 
speciﬁc
 
in
 
that,
 
that
 
would
 
potentially
 
adjust
 
your
 
strategy
 
for
 
your
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
business
 
going
 
forward?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
No,
 
great
 
question.
 
Certainly,
 
the
 
market
 
slowdown,
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
is
 
speciﬁcally
 
focused
 
primarily
 
at
 
EV,
 
solar,
 
and
 
industrial.
 
And
 
those
 
are
 
the
 
three
 
things
 
we've
 
seen
 
slowdown
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
year
 
as
 
the
 
whole
 
industry
 
has
 
seen
 
them.
 
So
 
that's
 
certainly
 
a
 
ﬁrst-order
 
eﬀect.
 
But
 
also,
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
increasing
 
our
 
focus
 
as
 
a
 
company
 
around
 
strategic
 
applications
 
last
 
quarter,
 
and
 
that's
 
really
 
in
 
the
 
EV
 
space,
 
where
 
we're
 
leveraging
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
together
 
with
 
our
 
system
 
reference
 
designs.
 
And
 
those
 
have
 
increased
 
dramatically
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
pipeline,
 
the
 
design
 
wins,
 
a
 
big
 
percentage
 
of
 
that
 
$450
 
million
 
of
 
design
 
wins
 
last
 
year
 
was
 
in
 
the
 
EV
 
space,
 
which
 
leverages
 
both
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
Secondarily,
 
as
 
I
 
said
 
with
 
roadside
 
chargers,
 
that's
 
all
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
shifting
 
things
 
for
 
us.
 
And
 
then,
 
of
 
course,
 
we're
 
just
 
rolling
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
couple
 
of
 
quarters,
 
the
 
data
 
center
 
strategy,
 
which
 
again
 
has
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
playing
 
into
 
it.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
had
 
our
 
own
 
investment
 
and
 
focus
 
areas
 
to
 
sort
 
of
 
work
 
through,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
we're
 
starting
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
come
 
through,
 
particularly
 
as
 
the
 
market
 
improves.
 
But
 
even
 
without
 
that
 
market
 
improvement,
 
we'll
 
see
 
these
 
design
 
wins
 
kicking
 
in
 
and
 
the
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
business
 
growing
 
nicely
 
throughout
 
the
 
year.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
from
 
Needham
 
&
 
Company.
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
I
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
ask
 
and
 
make
 
sure,
 
Todd,
 
I
 
heard
 
you
 
right
 
on
 
the
 
OpEx
 
beyond
 
Q1.
 
Did
 
you
 
say
 
it
 
would
 
come
 
down
 
to
 
$15.5
 
million?
 
And
 
if
 
that's
 
right,
 
how
 
long
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
you
 
can
 
keep
 
it
 
at
 
that
 
level?
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
guess
 
a
 
follow-up
 
question.
 
Obviously,
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
cut
 
OpEx
 
now
 
by
 
roughly
 
25%.
 
How
 
much
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
you've
 
cut
 
here?
 
Or
 
do
 
you
 
feel
 
like
 
you're
 
starting
 
to
 
potentially
 
limit
 
growth
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
new
 
opportunities
 
with
 
the
 
cuts
 
you've
 
made?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Quinn.
 
Let
 
me
 
take
 
that
 
ﬁrst
 
question.
 
So
 
yes,
 
$15.5
 
million
 
on
 
a
 
go-forward
 
basis,
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
keep
 
that
 
fairly
 
ﬂat
 
on
 
a
 
go-forward
 
basis
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
leverage
 
what
 
we
 
currently
 
have
 
in
 
our
 
business.
 
And
 
so
 
we
 
don't
 
expect
 
much
 
growth
 
on
 
that
 
OpEx
 
number.
 
In
 
regards
 
to
 
your
 
second
 
question,
 
basically,
 
yes,
 
it
 
is
 
any
 
fat
 
left
 
in
 
the
 
business.
 
We
 
have
 
been
 
pretty
 
diligent
 
in
 
looking
 
internally
 
and
 
on
 
acquisition
 
synergies,
 
and
 
we
 
feel
 
like
 
the
 
business
 
is
 
rightsized
 
right
 
now.
 
So
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
see
 
any
 
more
 
fat
 
to
 
trim.
 
We
 
are
 
properly
 
sized
 
to
 
grow,
 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
that
 
we're
 
seeing
 
today
 
and
 
across
 
markets
 
such
 
as
 
data
 
center,
 
EV,
 
and
 
mobile.
 
Quinn
 
Bolton
 
And
 
maybe
 
if
 
I
 
could
 
just
 
quick
 
one
 
on
 
the
 
data
 
center.
 
I
 
think
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
you
 
guys
 
had
 
sort
 
of
 
thought
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
$10
 
million
 
to
 
$20
 
million
 
business
 
in
 
2025.
 
Just
 
wondering
 
if
 
that's
 
still
 
sort
 
of
 
the
 
right
 
ballpark
 
to
 
be
 
thinking
 
about
 
for
 
the
 
data
 
center
 
or
 
if
 
you've
 
seen
 
any
 
movement
 
in
 
that
 
kind
 
of
 
expectation.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Quinn.
 
We're
 
not
 
obviously
 
giving
 
out
 
full-year
 
guidance
 
or
 
breaking
 
it
 
down
 
by
 
sector,
 
but
 
do
 
feel
 
good
 
about
 
the
 
trajectory.
 
We
 
started
 
ramping
 
in
 
Q3,
 
as
 
you
 
know.
 
The
 
design
 
wins
 
grew
 
nicely.
 
I
 
mentioned
 
40
 
total
 
for
 
the
 
year.
 
I
 
think
 
through
 
Q3,
 
it
 
was
 
only
 
9
 
or
 
10
 
year-to-date
 
last
 
year.
 
So
 
a
 
really
 
strong
 
Q4
 
design
 
win
 
period,
 
which
 
will
 
only
 
help
 
to
 
accelerate
 
that.
 
So
 
no
 
speciﬁc
 
breakout
 
for
 
the
 
year,
 
but
 
the
 
trajectory
 
is
 
good
 
and
 
growing
 
sequentially
 
throughout
 
'25.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
from
 
Rosenblatt
 
Securities.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
Mine
 
is
 
also
 
centered
 
around
 
a
 
data
 
center.
 
Of
 
the
 
40
 
design
 
wins,
 
can
 
you
 
describe
 
kind
 
of
 
what
 
the
 
bell
 
curve
 
is
 
of
 
the
 
various
 
power
 
supplies?
 
You
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
press
 
release,
 
it's
 
2.7
 
kilowatts
 
to
 
8.5
 
kilowatts.
 
But
 
I
 
guess
 
is
 
it
 
weighted
 
on
 
one
 
side
 
or
 
the
 
other?
 
Is
 
it
 
right
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
where
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
designs
 
are?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Good
 
question.
 
It
 
started
 
oﬀ
 
pretty
 
broad
 
from
 
even
 
some
 
below
 
2
 
kilowatts,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
little
 
surprising
 
because
 
our
 
technology
 
is
 
best
 
for
 
the
 
high
 
density,
 
the
 
high
 
power,
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
Kevin.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
in
 
many
 
cases,
 
people
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
try
 
it
 
out.
 
They
 
know
 
the
 
future
 
of
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
for
 
data
 
center
 
power
 
supplies
 
because
 
the
 
future
 
is
 
high
 
density
 
and
 
high
 
eﬃciency.
 
But
 
now
 
we're
 
seeing,
 
I
 
think,
 
the
 
sweet
 
spot
 
is
 
really
 
where
 
you
 
can
 
max
 
out
 
that
 
power
 
density.
 
And
 
there's
 
two
 
form
 
factors
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
center
 
for
 
AC
 
to
 
DC
 
power
 
supplies.
 
There
 
are
 
CRPS
 
form
 
factors.
 
We
 
pushed
 
that
 
to
 
its
 
limit
 
at
 
4.5
 
kilowatts,
 
and
 
we're
 
seeing
 
nice
 
pickup,
 
probably
 
more
 
concentrated
 
there
 
or
 
you
 
can
 
go
 
where
 
the
 
entire
 
power
 
shelf
 
is
 
dedicated
 
to
 
power
 
supplies,
 
that's
 
the
 
ORV
 
speciﬁcation.
 
There,
 
we
 
pushed
 
it
 
to
 
8.5
 
kilowatts
 
and
 
going
 
even
 
higher.
 
So
 
I'd
 
look
 
at
 
those
 
higher
 
power
 
levels
 
as
 
where
 
we're
 
seeing
 
the
 
increased
 
concentration
 
because
 
that's
 
really
 
where
 
that
 
GaN
 
and
 
SiC
 
combination
 
can
 
give
 
you
 
really
 
the
 
eﬃciencies
 
and
 
density
 
silicon
 
can't
 
touch,
 
and
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
keep
 
pushing
 
those
 
limits
 
going
 
forward.
 
Kevin
 
Cassidy
 
And
 
just
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
other
 
questions.
 
Are
 
these
 
deployments,
 
are
 
they
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
tied
 
to
 
any
 
particular
 
GPUs?
 
Or
 
are
 
these
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
deployed
 
despite
 
any
 
GPU
 
upgrade
 
cycle?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
think
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
now
 
are
 
shifting
 
beyond
 
Blackwell
 
to
 
Reuben.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
without
 
obviously
 
getting
 
into
 
customer
 
conﬁdential
 
speciﬁc
 
projects,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
market
 
trends,
 
I
 
think
 
we'll
 
see
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
designs
 
starting
 
now.
 
They're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
Reuben-focused
 
or,
 
let's
 
say,
 
Reuben's
 
class
 
of
 
processor-focused.
 
And
 
it's
 
not
 
all
 
about
 
NVIDIA.
 
Of
 
course,
 
we're
 
seeing
 
other
 
processors
 
pop
 
up,
 
traditional
 
server
 
ones
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
new
 
AI
 
ones
 
that
 
are
 
getting
 
into
 
the
 
mix
 
as
 
well.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
right
 
now,
 
we're
 
kind
 
of
 
focused
 
on
 
the
 
next
 
generation
 
that
 
the
 
new
 
designs
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
drive
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
ramps
 
in
 
'26
 
at
 
this
 
point.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
from
 
Charter
 
Equity
 
Research.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
I
 
was
 
hoping
 
you
 
could
 
talk
 
a
 
bit
 
about
 
the
 
distributor
 
disengagement.
 
Was
 
that
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
reduction
 
plan
 
or
 
something
 
else?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
No,
 
that
 
was
 
separate.
 
Given
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
performance
 
across
 
silicon
 
carbide,
 
we
 
decided
 
to
 
replace
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
channel
 
partners
 
because
 
they
 
really
 
weren't
 
achieving
 
the
 
design
 
wins
 
we
 
were
 
expecting
 
across
 
EV
 
and
 
industrial
 
and
 
their
 
lack
 
of
 
ability
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
some
 
delivered
 
products.
 
But
 
on
 
a
 
go-forward
 
basis,
 
we
 
have
 
turned
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
channel
 
partner,
 
and
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
help
 
us
 
with
 
our
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
And
 
then
 
it's
 
good
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
your
 
cash
 
burn
 
has
 
slowed
 
a
 
bit
 
or
 
a
 
pretty
 
good
 
bit
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
two
 
quarters.
 
How
 
are
 
you
 
thinking
 
about
 
raising
 
capital
 
at
 
all?
 
I
 
mean,
 
are
 
you
 
comfortable
 
with
 
your
 
current
 
cash
 
balance
 
and
 
the
 
cost
 
reductions
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
wait
 
out
 
the
 
cyclical
 
slowdown?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
That's
 
a
 
great
 
question.
 
To
 
your
 
point,
 
we
 
ﬁnished
 
the
 
year
 
with
 
$87
 
million.
 
We
 
burned
 
$12
 
million
 
in
 
cash
 
in
 
Q4.
 
And
 
on
 
a
 
go-forward
 
basis,
 
if
 
we
 
look
 
past
 
one-time
 
events
 
in
 
Q1,
 
we
 
do
 
expect
 
that
 
cash
 
usage
 
to
 
decrease
 
over
 
time.
 
And
 
so
 
right
 
now,
 
we
 
have
 
two-plus
 
years
 
of
 
cash
 
available
 
to
 
us.
 
So
 
we
 
don't
 
see
 
any
 
need
 
organically
 
to
 
raise
 
cash.
 
However,
 
as
 
we've
 
stated
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
strategic
 
initiative
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
pursue,
 
then
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
an
 
avenue
 
where
 
we'd
 
raise
 
cash.

Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jon
 
Tanwanteng
 
from
 
CJS
 
Securities.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
$450
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
design
 
win
 
pipeline.
 
Maybe
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
that
 
falls
 
into
 
this
 
year,
 
next
 
year,
 
and
 
the
 
year
 
after
 
as
 
you
 
see
 
a
 
schedule
 
from
 
today?
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
diﬀerent
 
end
 
markets
 
can
 
act
 
diﬀerently
 
there.
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes.
 
Thanks,
 
Jon.
 
It's
 
important
 
to
 
clarify,
 
it's
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
time
 
to
 
give
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
total
 
design
 
win
 
indication
 
coming
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
pipeline.
 
So
 
ﬁrst,
 
let
 
me
 
clarify
 
design
 
win
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
purchase
 
order,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
where
 
the
 
customer
 
has
 
actually
 
selected
 
Navitas
 
to
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
production
 
hardware.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
signiﬁcant
 
industry-wide
 
event,
 
let's
 
say,
 
or
 
common
 
term
 
to
 
get
 
into
 
that
 
design
 
validation
 
phase,
 
which
 
is
 
what
 
people
 
also
 
call
 
it.
 
The
 
$450
 
million
 
does
 
represent
 
the
 
lifetime
 
revenue.
 
We
 
take
 
a
 
pretty
 
conservative
 
view.
 
Mobile
 
and
 
consumer
 
products
 
may
 
be
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
years.
 
The
 
more
 
industrial
 
or
 
higher
 
power
 
markets
 
maybe
 
3
 
or
 
4
 
years.
 
So
 
it's
 
spread
 
out
 
over
 
that
 
lifetime
 
period.
 
But
 
to
 
your
 
question,
 
when
 
does
 
it
 
start
 
to
 
ramp?
 
We
 
also
 
try
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
conservative
 
view
 
of
 
the
 
ramp
 
time.
 
So
 
we've
 
only
 
considered
 
programs
 
that
 
are
 
ramping
 
in
 
'25,
 
'26
 
or
 
'27.
 
We
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
things
 
that
 
could
 
kick
 
in
 
or
 
start
 
in
 
'28
 
or
 
beyond,
 
but
 
we
 
excluded
 
them.
 
So
 
between
 
all
 
of
 
my
 
comments
 
there,
 
it
 
kind
 
of
 
gives
 
you
 
a
 
feel
 
for
 
how
 
does
 
that
 
layers
 
in
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
3
 
years
 
and
 
runs
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
1
 
to
 
4
 
years.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
And
 
then
 
could
 
you
 
help
 
us
 
understand
 
the
 
margin
 
proﬁle
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year
 
as
 
you
 
get
 
these
 
design
 
wins
 
ramped?
 
How
 
much
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
higher
 
volume
 
GaN
 
products
 
and
 
higher
 
margin
 
ones
 
in
 
things
 
like
 
data
 
centers
 
versus
 
recovery
 
in
 
SiC
 
markets?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes.
 
While
 
we
 
don't
 
comment
 
on
 
margin
 
speciﬁc
 
as
 
it
 
relates
 
to
 
the
 
end
 
market,
 
we
 
always
 
know
 
that
 
our
 
corporate
 
margin,
 
mobile
 
is
 
always
 
slightly
 
below
 
our
 
corporate
 
margins
 
and
 
higher
 
power
 
markets
 
such
 
as
 
EV
 
and
 
data
 
center
 
will
 
be
 
bigger
 
than
 
our
 
company
 
margin
 
level.
 
And
 
so
 
as
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
picks
 
up
 
and
 
those
 
higher
 
markets
 
start
 
to
 
convert
 
design
 
wins,
 
we
 
do
 
expect
 
some
 
marginal
 
margin
 
growth.
 
But
 
long
 
term,
 
I
 
think
 
what
 
those
 
markets
 
lead
 
us
 
to
 
is
 
our
 
long-term
 
goal
 
of
 
50%
 
plus
 
margin,
 
and
 
that's
 
no
 
change
 
from
 
that.
 
Jonathan
 
Tanwanteng
 
And
 
then
 
one
 
more,
 
if
 
I
 
could.
 
Just
 
the
 
reduction
 
in
 
OpEx
 
that
 
you're
 
talking
 
about
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
2
 
quarters,
 
how
 
much
 
is
 
coming
 
out
 
of
 
R&D
 
versus
 
SG&A?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
No,
 
great
 
question.
 
I
 
think
 
if
 
you
 
look
 
historically
 
at
 
our
 
splits,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
same
 
split
 
on
 
a
 
go-forward
 
basis
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
R&D
 
and
 
SG&A
 
as
 
we've
 
taken
 
those
 
synergies
 
out
 
via
 
the
 
acquisitions
 
from
 
both
 
avenues.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
again
 
from
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
from
 
Deutsche
 
Bank.
 
Ross
 
Seymore
 
Just
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
competitive
 
landscape.
 
Gene,
 
have
 
you
 
seen
 
any
 
signiﬁcant
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
aggressiveness
 
of
 
the
 
competition,
 
pricing,
 
need
 
to
 
burn
 
inventory,
 
any
 
sort
 
of
 
those
 
cyclical
 
dynamics,
 
especially
 
with
 
a
 
downturn
 
as
 
persistent
 
as
 
this
 
one,
 
oftentimes,
 
you'll
 
get
 
those
 
sorts
 
of
 
desperation
 
by
 
about
 
this
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
cycle.
 
Have
 
you
 
seen
 
that?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
saw
 
it
 
more
 
concentrated,
 
not
 
surprisingly
 
on
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
just
 
because
 
that's
 
where
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
market
 
slowdowns
 
occurred.
 
So
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
year,
 
even
 
1.5
 
years
 
ago
 
when
 
we
 
started
 
talking
 
about
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
solar
 
slowdowns
 
in
 
industrial
 
and
 
EV.
 
With
 
that
 
slowdown,
 
you
 
get
 
pockets
 
of
 
inventory,
 
you
 
also
 
get
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
ASP
 
erosion.
 
That
 
does
 
seem
 
to
 
have
 
stabilized.
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
inventory
 
pockets
 
are
 
reducing
 
and
 
stabilizing,
 
maybe
 
one
 
more
 
quarter,
 
as
 
we
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
prepared
 
remarks,
 
and
 
the
 
ASP
 
erosion
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
stabilizing.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
all
 
pretty
 
encouraging.
 
GaN,
 
not
 
as
 
dramatic
 
because,
 
again,
 
it's
 
been
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
healthier
 
supply
 
and
 
demand
 
across
 
the
 
mobile
 
and
 
consumer
 
space
 
and
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
appliance.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
from
 
Craig-Hallum.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
Gene,
 
maybe
 
I'll
 
ask
 
a
 
question
 
here
 
on
 
the
 
calendar
 
'25
 
sales
 
outlook.
 
I
 
know
 
you're
 
not
 
quantifying
 
any
 
sort
 
of
 
thought
 
process
 
here.
 
But
 
obviously,
 
last
 
year
 
had
 
a
 
really
 
good
 
year
 
in
 
GaN
 
and
 
obviously,
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
markets
 
were
 
very
 
challenged
 
to
 
say
 
the
 
least
 
here.
 
How
 
do
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
2025
 
between
 
the
 
2
 
material
 
systems
 
here?
 
Is
 
one
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
notably
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
other?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
I
 
think
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned
 
earlier,
 
Rich,
 
we
 
really
 
like
 
our
 
focused
 
strategy
 
on
 
data
 
centers,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
growth
 
in
 
both
 
GaN
 
and
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
We're
 
using
 
that
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
in
 
the
 
PFC
 
circuit
 
for
 
most
 
designs
 
GaN
 
on
 
the
 
second
 
stage
 
or
 
LLC,
 
which's
 
getting
 
us
 
the
 
best
 
eﬃciency,
 
and
 
the
 
best
 
density
 
for
 
the
 
customer.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
trend
 
speaks
 
for
 
itself.
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
same
 
kind
 
of
 
thing,
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned,
 
is
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
EV
 
onboard
 
chargers.
 
I'm
 
bullish
 
that
 
roadside
 
chargers
 
are
 
also
 
improving
 
as
 
that
 
infrastructure
 
does
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
built
 
out
 
around
 
the
 
world,
 
and
 
that's
 
100%
 
silicon
 
carbide.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
all
 
of
 
those
 
will
 
have
 
healthy
 
growth
 
going
 
forward,
 
I
 
think,
 
for
 
both
 
technologies
 
because
 
they're
 
often
 
used
 
in
 
combination
 
with
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
our
 
key
 
market
 
growth
 
drivers.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
Maybe
 
a
 
quick
 
question
 
for
 
Todd.
 
I've
 
heard
 
about
 
the
 
new
 
OpEx
 
spending
 
level
 
here
 
and
 
obviously,
 
still
 
have
 
a
 
proﬁle
 
of
 
50%
 
gross
 
margins
 
here
 
at
 
the
 
high-end
 
model
 
here
 
and
 
then
 
also
 
getting
 
to
 
EBITDA
 
breakeven
 
here.
 
I
 
guess
 
my
 
question
 
here,
 
is
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
revenue
 
per
 
quarter
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
that
 
breakeven
 
level?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes.
 
Right.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
our
 
second
 
reduction.
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
went
 
from
 
breakeven
 
EBITDA
 
in
 
the
 
mid-50s
 
to
 
the
 
mid-40s.
 
This
 
brings
 
you
 
to
 
a
 
breakeven
 
of
 
the
 
high
 
30s,
 
obviously,
 
dependent
 
on
 
gross
 
margins,
 
but
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
feel
 
like
 
this
 
OpEx
 
level
 
brings
 
us
 
to
 
a
 
breakeven
 
in
 
the
 
high
 
30s
 
of
 
revenue
 
per
 
quarter.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
back
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
from
 
Charter
 
Equity
 
Research.
 
Jack
 
Egan
 
You
 
mentioned
 
you
 
found
 
some
 
additional
 
synergies
 
in
 
OpEx.
 
And
 
last
 
quarter,
 
you
 
said
 
you
 
were
 
targeting
 
a
 
14%
 
reduction
 
in
 
force.
 
So
 
is
 
that
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
higher
 
like
 
up
 
towards
 
20%
 
now?
 
Or
 
were
 
the
 
cost
 
savings
 
found
 
elsewhere?
 
Todd
 
Glickman
 
Yes.
 
These
 
cost
 
savings
 
were
 
found
 
elsewhere
 
as
 
we've
 
gone
 
through
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
acquisitions
 
historically.
 
So
 
those
 
cost
 
savings
 
were
 
separate
 
from
 
the
 
ones
 
in
 
Q4
 
and
 
were
 
directly
 
related
 
to
 
synergies
 
across
 
those
 
acquisitions.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
back
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
from
 
Craig-Hallum.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
Well,
 
that
 
was
 
getting
 
back
 
in
 
here.
 
Let's
 
hear
 
2
 
questions.
 
I
 
got
 
on
 
the
 
call
 
late,
 
so
 
I
 
may
 
have
 
missed
 
some
 
prepared
 
remarks
 
here.
 
But
 
Gene,
 
did
 
I
 
catch
 
accurately
 
that
 
you
 
had
 
a
 
very
 
market
 
acceleration
 
design
 
wins
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
center
 
space
 
here?
 
I
 
think
 
if
 
I
 
heard
 
you
 
correctly,
 
10
 
through
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
3
 
quarters
 
and
 
then
 
30
 
in
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
40.
 
If
 
that's
 
accurate
 
here,
 
can
 
you
 
kind
 
of
 
lay
 
out
 
the
 
dynamics
 
here,
 
what's
 
going
 
on?
 
Is
 
the
 
share
 
gains
 
acceleration
 
in
 
the
 
market?
 
And
 
then
 
when
 
do
 
these
 
design
 
wins
 
go
 
to
 
market?
 
Can
 
they
 
happen
 
this
 
year?
 
Or
 
is
 
it
 
beyond
 
this
 
year?
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes,
 
both
 
are
 
good
 
points.
 
And
 
yes,
 
you
 
got
 
the
 
facts
 
right,
 
Rich.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
is
 
an
 
acceleration.
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
think
 
it's
 
probably
 
an
 
acceleration
 
of
 
share
 
gain,
 
but
 
let's
 
hold
 
that
 
until
 
we
 
sort
 
of
 
deliver
 
on
 
the
 
POs
 
and
 
the
 
revenue.
 
But
 
certainly,
 
the
 
market
 
continues
 
to
 
accelerate,
 
and
 
we're
 
pleased
 
to
 
see
 
even
 
after
 
things
 
like
 
DeepSeq
 
that
 
the
 
CapEx
 
numbers
 
keep
 
going
 
up
 
globally,
 
the
 
power
 
requirements
 
even
 
continue
 
to
 
go
 
up.
 
As
 
I
 
talked
 
about,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
our
 
design
 
wins
 
are
 
now
 
pushing
 
to
 
that
 
power
 
limit,
 
4.5
 
kilowatts
 
on
 
the
 
CRP,
 
8.5
 
kilowatts,
 
and
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
even
 
higher
 
than
 
that
 
on
 
the
 
OB3
 
platform
 
that
 
I
 
mentioned.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
all
 
a
 
pretty
 
encouraging
 
outlook
 
for
 
us.
 
Richard
 
Shannon
 
Just
 
another
 
big-picture
 
question
 
for
 
you,
 
Gene.
 
Just
 
obviously,
 
have
 
a
 
diﬀerent
 
geopolitical
 
environment
 
since
 
the
 
last
 
earnings
 
call.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
any
 
changes
 
that
 
you
 
would
 
highlight
 
either
 
positive
 
or
 
negative
 
globally.
 
Eugene
 
Sheridan
 
Yes.
 
Good
 
question.
 
Those
 
are
 
always
 
broad
 
macro
 
questions.
 
So
 
obviously,
 
there's
 
talk
 
about
 
tariﬀs,
 
hard
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
tariﬀs
 
play
 
out,
 
where
 
are
 
they,
 
which
 
countries,
 
how
 
do
 
people
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
equipment
 
level,
 
the
 
chip
 
level.
 
But
 
fundamentally,
 
we're
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
few
 
companies
 
doing
 
semiconductor
 
manufacturing
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
As
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
built
 
silicon
 
carbide
 
at
 
X-FAB
 
in
 
Texas.
 
So
 
that
 
probably
 
puts
 
us
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
better
 
positioned
 
than
 
many
 
others.
 
We're
 
already
 
well
 
into
 
our
 
China
 
for
 
China
 
strategy,
 
which
 
is
 
really
 
about
 
providing
 
localized
 
support
 
for
 
our
 
China
 
customers
 
kind
 
of
 
defending
 
and
 
protecting
 
that
 
business,
 
but
 
also
 
trying
 
to
 
grow
 
and
 
accelerate
 
it
 
over
 
time.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
both
 
of
 
those
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
pretty
 
good
 
position
 
in
 
the
 
changing
 
macroeconomic
 
environment,
 
but
 
we'll
 
have
 
to
 
see.
 
It's
 
a
 
complicated
 
world
 
out
 
there.
 
Operator
 
Seeing
 
as
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
more
 
questions
 
in
 
the
 
queue,
 
that
 
concludes
 
our
 
question-and-answer
 
session.
 
That
 
also
 
concludes
 
this
 
call.
