Good day and thank you for standing by . Welcome to the AST SpaceMobile first (sic) [ second ] quarter 2024 business update call. Please be advised that
today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today , Scott Wisniewski, Chief Strategy Of ficer of AST
SpaceMobile. Please go ahead.
Scott Wisniewski
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone.
Let me refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer .
During today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, and as a
result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual events to dif fer materially from the forward-looking statements on this call.
For more information about these risks and uncertainties, please refer to the Risk Factors section of AST SpaceMobile's annual report on Form 10-K for
the year that ended December 31, 2023, with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other documents filed by AST SpaceMobile and the SEC
from time to time. Also, after our initial remarks, we will begin the Q&A  section with questions submitted by our shareholders. W elcome, everyone.
For those of you who may be new to our company and mission, there are over 5 billion mobile phones in use today around the world, but many of us still
experience gaps in coverage as we live, work, and travel. There are also still billions of people without cellular broadband and who remain unconnected to
the global economy . The markets we are pursuing are massive, and the problem we are solving is important and touches nearly all of us. In this backdrop,
AST SpaceMobile is building the first and only global cellular broadband network in space to operate directly with everyday mobile phones, supported by
our extensive IP  and patent portfolio. It is now my pleasure to pass it over to Chairman and CEO, Abel Avellan, who will go through our activities since the
last public update.
Abel Avellan
Thank you, Scott. Good day to everyone. The hard work of the past few years is culminating in a period of tremendous activity and excitement for AST
SpaceMobile.
We have moved past a primary focus on improving our technology and funding our growth into the next phase of executing our vision and operationalizing
our business.
We are shifting from R&D to full-scale production and commercialization of our space-based cellular broadband network.
Our technology is proven, patented, and validated.
Our commercial ecosystem is in place and growing. W e're funded to achieve our near-term goals and reach initial revenue.
Our business is now accelerating.
Just last week, our first 5 commercial satellites called BlueBirds, arrived in Cape Canaveral, Florida, after completing final assembly at our manufacturing
facilities in Texas. These satellites are now undergoing final preparation for integration with Falcon 9 launch vehicle for a dedicated mission.
We have a 7-day contracted orbital launch window in the first half of September .
Our current expectation is that we will launch in the first half of September .
So this is ultimately based on a variety of factors outside our control, including the weather conditions.
As the target date is finalized, we will communicate this with the public. To put our first commercial satellite into orbit really is a culmination of significant
progress to-date. I am incredibly proud of our team.

We have spent over 7-years and over $1 billion of investment dollars to get to this point, along the way , generating over 3,400 patent and patent-pending
claims. Completing the assembly , testing, and other logistics to ensure that our BlueBirds were ready to transport to Florida and were ready to launch is a
major milestone for our company and mission. These BlueBirds will each be the largest communications array ever to be deployed commercially into low-
Earth orbit. These arrays provide a strong signal that can reach standard smartphones directly to provide cellular broadband service and other non-
communication government applications.
With these initial commercial satellites, we are targeting nearly 100% geographical coverage for the continental United States using premium 850-
megahertz low-band spectrum, which of fers superior signal penetration in the low-band spectrum range. Low-band frequencies travel longer distances
and penetrate deeper into buildings and through foliage compared to higher frequencies. These first 5 satellites will provide non-continuous cellular
broadband service nationwide across the United States. After a few months of in-orbit service activation, this initial service for AT&T and V erizon, beta test
users will start with 5,600 cells across the country . This program was made possible in large part due to the continued and growing support of our strategic
partners.
During the second quarter , we secured another major strategic financing partner and customer , adding V erizon to a top-tier group that also includes AT&T,
Vodafone, Google, American Tower , Rakuten, Bell Canada, and others. This $100 million commitment from V erizon, including $65 million of commercial
prepayments, and $35 million of convertible notes just a few months after strategic financing with AT&T, Google, and V odafone. It's another powerful
validation of our technology and our business model. This investment closely follows the definitive agri-commercial agreement announced with AT&T in
May. Bringing on board 2 major U.S. mobile operators in the most valuable wireless market in the world was a transformational commercial milestone for
us.
During the last few months, we shifted our manufacturing focus to increase Block 2 production, incorporating the lesson learned from manufacturing of the
first 5 commercial satellites. W e'll continue planning and initial production for the first 17 Block 2 satellites to be built in phases within the initial launch in
Q1 of 2025. These satellites, when equipped with our ASIC, will be approximately 2,400 square feet in size and are expected to support up to tenfold
improvement of processing bandwidth per satellite compared to Block 1 satellites that we are launching this September .
We expect to start using our ASIC on our sixth Block 2 satellite, and we can use existing FPGA  configuration for as long as it's required. Alongside this
activity , we have not lost sight of our technology roadmap. W e can now report that we have completed the ASIC chip tape out with the SNC. This
technology is the cornerstone of our BlueBird Block 2 program. The AST5000 ASIC is a novel custom low-power architecture developed to enable up to a
tenfold improvement in processing bandwidth on each satellite, unlocking opportunity for seamless space-based cellular broadband services worldwide.
With the 3 bits per hertz that we have demonstrated using BlueW alker 3 and our planned commercial satellite capacity of up to 40 megahertz per beam,
this translates into performance of up to 120 megabits peak data rates. The completion of the tape out is a milestone that marks the culmination of 5-years
of dedicated research, development, and engineering expertise with approximately 45 million all developed. In summary , we want to change the world.
We're seeking to connect the billions of people who are not connected, improving public safety , enabling global commerce, and for the average user who
can see fewer drop calls through trading dead zones and missing connections. This has not been easy . We entered a new phase for our company . I am
deeply proud of the team we have assembled and confident in the plan ahead of us. I will now pass to Scott to provide more details on our commercial
and regulatory process.
Scott Wisniewski
Thank you, Abel.
As we accelerate the commercialization of our network, I wanted to spend a few moments to go through the commercial and regulatory progress during
the quarter , including some early wins for the first 5 commercial satellites. Earlier this month, we received an initial license for space-based operations in
the U.S. from the FCC. This initial license authorizes AST SpaceMobile to operate using V , S, and UHF frequencies to support our gateway , feeder link,
and telemetry tracking and control operations for the first 5 commercial BlueBird satellites. This license will serve as our primary license for operations in
the U.S. over the life of the constellation, so it was a big deal for the company and our commercialization, both in the U.S. and at the blueprint globally .
Going forward, we continue to work with the FCC, as well as our partners AT&T and V erizon, to apply for upgrades and modifications to this license to
facilitate full-scale commercial operations on wireless frequencies and to expand the license to support our operations over time. This FCC authorization
followed the March 2024 update of our constellation filings with the International Telecommunication Union and related filings with the FCC that placed our
planned commercial satellites under the jurisdiction of the United States. This initiative represented a closer strategic alignment of our network build-out
and future network operations with the United States and is a key piece of our overall regulatory strategy .
In addition to the progress Abel reported with AT&T and V erizon, we continue to believe our patented technology , including our large phased-array antenna
technology in space, creates significant opportunities for new mission-critical capabilities in the government sector .
We are moving forward with these dual-use capabilities on our constellation and expect to generate revenue from both commercial and government
applications. To this ef fect, earlier this year , we announced that AST SpaceMobile had been awarded a new contract through a prime contractor working
with the United States government. This initial phased contract, which covers the use of BlueW alker 3 as well as the first 5 commercial satellites, is well
underway . And during the second quarter , we completed successful in-orbit and ground tests, resulting in completed contractual milestones and top-line
revenue. This government sector strategy continues to show additional early signs of strength with 2 new U.S. government contract awards in recent
months to one of our prime contractors. Like the February contract, these awards represent relatively small revenue by themselves, but seek to evaluate
potential for full-scale, multi-year contracted services in the future.
As is customary , contracts for these 2 new opportunities are still being finalized, and we will provide detail if and when it becomes available.
Our primary commercialization strategy is to position for significant revenue opportunities as we scale the constellation, but this initial progress is
encouraging, and we believe the progress represents an upgraded outlook for additional and larger signed contract awards over time. With that, I will now
pass it to Andy Johnson, our new Chief Financial Of ficer, to take you through the financial update.

Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I joined AST this past May , because I believe wholeheartedly in the company's mission to close the digital
divide by connecting the unconnected and was convinced that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity after visiting the manufacturing facilities in Midland,
Texas. There, I saw firsthand the sophistication of the company's technology and, most importantly , the incredible commitment of our team, led by Abel, in
producing the world's first space-based cellular broadband service satellites. This is a seminal moment in the history of AST SpaceMobile, and I want to
personally thank all of my teammates for their dedication to our mission and delivering our first 5 commercial BlueBird satellites for launch in just a few
short weeks. I also want to thank Sean W allace, our former CFO, who continues to consult for us for his leadership, service to the company , and
partnership in making my transition seamless. It's a fantastic time to be a part of the AST SpaceMobile ecosystem, which includes our shareholders, our
talented employees across the globe, and our mobile network operator partners.
We are at the forefront of our commercial constellation deployment, and I deeply appreciate those of you who are on this life-changing journey with us.
Let's review the key operating metrics for the second quarter that are displayed on Slide 10.
On the first chart, we see for the second quarter of 2024, we had non-GAAP  adjusted cash operating expenses of $34.6 million versus $31.1 million in the
first quarter . Non-GAAP  adjusted operating expenses exclude certain non-cash operating costs, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based
compensation. These expenses are up slightly from the first quarter due to final Block 1 expenses, as we neared the finish line of producing 5 of the
largest satellites ever to be deployed in low-Earth orbit, including required travel expenses to the production site in Texas, expedited hiring of engineering
talent in connection with our Block 2 mechanical work, as we ramp up production of our next satellites, and the impact of an approximately 1 million one-
time G&A  expense reversal in Q1 that af fects the quarter-over-quarter comparison.
Turning towards the second chart on this page.
Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $21.2 million versus $26.6 million for the first quarter . The figure was made up of capitalized direct
materials and labor for Block 1 and Block 2 satellites and additional facility and production equipment for our 185,000-square-foot assembly , integration,
and test facilities in Midland.
As expected, capital expenditures trended down in connection with the completion of the Block 1 satellites ahead of ramping Block 2 production. By the
end of the second quarter , we incurred and paid all amounts for the 5 Block 1 satellites. Total spend for those satellites did not materially exceed our prior
estimate of $1 15 million. The design, integration, testing, and launch of satellites and related ground infrastructure is capital-intensive. W e do expect our
experience completing Block 1 will allow us to leverage our learnings to improve and optimize manufacturing costs for our Block 2 satellites. And on the
final chart on this slide, we ended the second quarter with $287.6 million in cash, up from $212.4 million at the end of the first quarter . This increase
includes $55 million of previously announced investment from our valued MNO partner V erizon, inclusive of a $20 million prepayment for future cellular
broadband service.
Our strengthened cash position at the end of Q2 also reflects our disciplined and ef fective use of our now completed at-the-market, or ATM, equity facility ,
from which we raised approximately $80 million during the quarter at increasing market prices for our common stock.
As of the end of July , we completed the 2-year use of the existing ATM facility and the existing common stock purchase facility with $164 million of total
raise to support operating expenses and preserve our capital for building the constellation.
During this 2-year period, we were prudent in our timing and use of these facilities, consuming less than 75% of the combined facility's capacity and
raising capital at more than a 50% premium to our stock's volume-weighted average price.
We continue to consider using the balance of our senior credit facility , which has a gross amount available to us of $51.5 million. To-date, however , our
efforts around raising strategic capital, including non-dilutive prepayments from our MNO partners as we ready for service, are taking precedence over the
senior credit facility , which in turn continues to reduce negative carry we would have incurred if we had accessed the facility earlier .
Our ability to access this facility remains subject to certain conditions and approvals. I'd like to reiterate that we currently have no plans for the remainder
of this year to pursue an underwritten public equity of fering. W e previously provided guidance on our expected operating expense levels.
We have been supporting the development and production ef forts of our 2 critical satellite designs, Block 1 and Block 2, our ASIC chip design, and the 5
Block 1 satellites. The completion of this Block 1 work and a significant portion of the Block 2 development and ASIC tape-out completion is expected to
result in a reduction in our adjusted operating expenses and capital expenditures in future periods. Consistent with the first and second quarters of 2024,
we continue to project that our adjusted cash operating expenses for the remainder of the year will come in within a range of $30 million to $35 million per
quarter based on business conditions and speed of constellation deployment, and as the Block 2 design approaches completion and our focus turns to
scaled production. W e believe ef forts to optimize our OpEx will result in a run rate at the low end of that range. These figures will vary depending upon
manufacturing activity in each period. This guidance does not include the expected costs of approximately $15 million related to the tape-out and initial
production of our ASIC chips. These ASIC-related costs will be recognized as an R&D expense in subsequent quarters in 2024 as milestones are
completed. Timing of the changes in our adjusted operating expenditures and capital expenditures, as I have just described, could be delayed or may not
be realized due to a variety of factors.
Finally , we continue to work on developing a financing package from export credit agencies to source cost-ef fective, long-term debt funding of large
projects.
We will keep you abreast of our progress. It's been a fantastic first 90 days. I look forward in the future to getting to know many of you and working hard to
drive value for our shareholders as we position AST for full-scale commercial operations. And with that, this completes the presentation component of our
earnings call, and I pass it back to Scott.
Scott Wisniewski
Thank you, Andy .

Before we go to the queue of analyst questions, we'd like to address a few of the questions submitted by our investors. Operator , could you please start us
off with the first question?
Operator
Tanner asks, will you wait until the first BB Block 2 is launched and unfolded before working on additional BBs?
Abel Avellan
No, the answer is no. W e're already working on the next build of the subsequent satellites.
We are actually in the process of building parts for the next 17 satellites. The main mechanical system is, yes, changes on upgrade, but it's basically the
same as BlueW alker 3 and Block 1. And we will not wait for that deployment to continue building.
So we're in the process of building. W e actually started a few months back our next satellites built.
With the next satellite, we will have a satellite that will be equipped with the FPGA  and a satellite that will be equipped with the ASIC. And the first launch
of 4 will be based on FPGAs. The subsequent satellites will be of Block 2, first 4 Block 2. And the subsequent after that will be all based on ASIC, which is
a tenfold improvement compared to the FPGA. W e're fully focused on building our next batch of satellites and to get them on the air as soon as possible.
Operator
Matt asks, you mentioned that full U.S. coverage is the first priority . What regions will you look to fulfill next and in what time frame?
Abel Avellan
Yes, our -- obviously , the U.S. market is the largest, a more developed wireless market. And in this market, we have AT&T and V erizon. And yes, we will be
prioritizing the deployment for the U.S. market. Then we will prioritize investors and MNOs that are paying prepaid revenue. That includes V odafone
markets, that include Rakuten in Japan, and then new MNOs that are going to be prepaying for initialization of the service as a priority .
We are launching on a 50-degree of inclination.
So basically , we can cover all the latitudes from 59 degrees north to 59 degrees south.
So we have the benefit of being able to select the regions that we prioritize according to prepayments priorities set by new investors.
Operator
Cody asks, what concerns does the company have being that we are currently in a solar maximum? How susceptible are your satellites to solar storms?
Abel Avellan
Well, first of all, before I answer the question, let me remind everybody about how we design these satellites. These satellites they're big. They are built
out of identical modules that we call microns that make this satellite system very resilient. And it's built out of a distributed system that no one single part
can make the satellite to fail. And that makes it very resilient to the space weather , including solar storms and other conditions. W e had all the data that we
have collected over 2 years operating BlueW alker 3. And we really -- of course, we have needed our time to react to solar activities, but never having a
failure caused by it.
So we are very confident on our satellite resilient is where it need to be as it relates to weather conditions.
Operator
Tanner asks, after the first BB Block 2, how many at a time will be launched?
Abel Avellan
Okay . Well, we have decided -- but we have designed the system to be launched agnostic.
So, we basically envelope our profile to be able to support basically every large or medium launch service provider and launch systems. And depending on
the size of the launch, I mean, on Block 1, we're launching 5 satellites in a Falcon 9. And depending on the launch configuration and the launch vehicle, it
will be anywhere between 4 per launch for the new larger Block 2s or 8 per launch, depending on the launch vehicles.
Scott Wisniewski
And with that, I'd like to thank our shareholders for submitting these questions. Operator , let's open the call to analyst questions now .
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Grif fin Boss with B. Riley Securities.
Griffin Boss
So first for me, the 17 satellites under construction is certainly more than what we expected. How would you characterize your current production
capacity? I know in the past, you've discussed expectations to reach something, I think, equivalent to 6 satellite per month cadence. Have you reached
that? Are you tracking better? Any more color would be helpful.
Abel Avellan
Yes, I mean, when we say 17 satellites, that referred to the subsystem that we are producing. They don't need to be all produced at the same time.
So we actually time them.
We use cookies on this site to provide a more responsive and personalized service. Continuing to browse, clicking I Agree, or closing this banner
indicates agreement. See our Cookie Policy  for more information.
So we start with the long lead items. W e start them first. The parts that take more time to get out of the factory , they are being produced for 17 units. And
for that, we buy parts in advance. W e start manufacturing them way in advance. And as we need it, so we keep ordering the dif ferent parts for the system.
Yes, we're ramping up.
We are accelerating our production cadence.
Going through the 5 first commercials that we're launching now in September has helped us to expand our production capacity . Also going forward, we
have work on vertically integrating around 95% of the subsystems.
So we either control the IP , manufacture by ourselves, and control the manufacturing process for around 95% of the satellites that are on build going
forward.
Griffin Boss
Thanks, Abel, for that color . And in terms of the initial Block 2 satellite launch, are you still tracking for the late 4Q, early 2025 kind of launch window there?
Are there any delays or issues you're seeing with the launch provider?
Abel Avellan
No, we're still tracking for Q1 2025.
Griffin Boss
Glad to hear it. And then, so Scott, there was sort of an informal interview with you recently on a financial blog where you cited some ARPU assumptions
for the U.S. I can't recall hearing the company formally mention potential ARPU in the past.
So I would love it if there are any assumptions or expectations for ARPU you can share today , especially now that you've got 2 definitive agreements
under your belt?
Scott Wisniewski
No, we've been making a lot of progress with commercial agreements, and alongside that, been advancing our go-to-market strategies, as you would
expect. W e don't have any pricing or go-to-market strategies to report at this time. And I think that article was misquoted. But we're very excited about the
revenue share model that we've been pushing for a long time, and we're very excited about the adoption rates and the ability to command a good wallet
on this service.
So no pricing guidance at this time, but I would say that go-to-market planning has definitely accelerated.
Griffin Boss
And last for me, very quickly , and I'll pass it of f, I just want to confirm that this new contract liabilities line item we're seeing in the statement of cash flows,
is that reflecting the V erizon revenue commitment? Or is that something else?
Andrew Johnson
Yes, this is Andy , Grif fin. I do think it's the revenue commitments against the prepayments and so forth, so none of that's revenue at this point yet until the
services are initiated.
Griffin Boss
Thanks, Andy , and welcome to the company .
Operator
Our next questions come from the line of Benjamin Sof f with Deutsche Bank.
Benjamin Sof f
Exciting quarter with a lot of interesting development. I was wondering, now that the satellites are on-site in Florida, can you walk us through the timeline
and key milestones between launching in early September until you get to commercial service?
Abel Avellan
Yes, we actually , Ben, how are you? So we actually indicate now , we were on final preparation for launch. The plan is to launch early September , first half
of September . We anticipate few months to basically activate service on those first 5 satellites.
We have 2 type of users already booked on them. One is a Gorman user , and then we have our MNOs.
We are prioritizing U.S., V odafone, and our investors and people that have an MNO that are preparing or are going to prepare for services.
So in terms of timeline is, we launch a few months to activate services, and then we are already preparing and have prepared all the ground infrastructure
to start connecting to the spacecraft.
So we will have some early usage immediately after for the Gorman, in parallel with the MNOs.
Benjamin Sof f
Okay . Great. And then just going back to the 17 Block 2 satellites, do you have any updated thoughts on the cost per satellite and the timing to launch
those?
Abel Avellan
We use cookies on this site to provide a more responsive and personalized service. Continuing to browse, clicking I Agree, or closing this banner
indicates agreement. See our Cookie Policy  for more information.
Yes, we are maintaining our guidance on cost. Actually , we continue to look for ways to continue to improve our cost basis, as we are getting close to 95%
vertical integration, but the guidance per satellite remain the same. And as I said, we're starting a launch campaign, starting in Q1, and then following up
with additional launches as the satellites are ready and the launches are available.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell with UBS.
Christopher Schoell
We've seen a number of regulatory milestones here in recent months. Can you help us think through your remaining approval process here in the U.S.
and the likely timeline for that? And I think there was general optimism previously that other countries could follow suit with similar rulemaking to the U.S.
Have you seen any evidence of that to date?
Scott Wisniewski
Chris, it's Scott here. Yes, so clearly , we're happy with the progress this year on the regulatory front, as we mentioned in our remarks. And the FCC does
truly play a leadership role globally with other countries.
So in our initial markets, we're working with our close partners on moving all the regulatory processes forward. W e've been relatively pleased with how
that's progressed with no showstoppers, really . We really view it as a process that we go through diligently and that the FCC's demonstrated a lot of
leadership this year with developing new rules for supplemental coverage from space and things like that.
So for us, I think initial markets are trending positively in the U.S.
Next milestones to look for , there'll be a lot of filings going forward.
I think part of commercial service is just there's a lot of regular filings that come.
So there'll be filings about gateways on the ground. There'll be filings about test campaigns on when we first start getting Block 1 going. And then the big
one is SCS rights in the U.S. with the FCC.
So that's something that will be, they'll start seeing filings on that with us and with our 2 partners in the U.S.
Christopher Schoell
Okay . Great. And if I can just fit in one more, I think you mentioned no public equity of fering this year , but as you look toward Block 2 and beyond, can you
just help us think through the timing of additional funding requirements and how do you think about the trade-of fs for dif ferent capital sources going
forward?
Andrew Johnson
Sure, this is Andy . Chris, thanks for the question.
So as we noted, I think our priority right now is to continue our current operating model of working on prepayment relationships with our MNO partners.
That's been a very ef fective way to raise required capital. And we have a number of MNO partners that we're making progress with in that respect.
So non-dilutive approach is sort of how we're viewing our near-term opportunity .
We also have, in that same vein, we have the opportunity to realize certain milestones in connection with the launch with respect to our existing MNO
partners among V odafone and AT&T and V erizon, which could be meaningful capital. And we'll continue to analyze what's available to us. W e're very
cognizant of dif ferent capital structures, debt, equity opportunities, but we wanted to reiterate the fact that we are focused on being good custodians and
weighing the capital needs that are inherent to a satellite business that's as capital-intensive as we are with the fact that our shareholders expect us to be
responsible as it relates to dilution.
So I reiterated our point from last quarter that we have no current plans to do a public security equities of fering. And that's our plan for the end of '24. And
we think we have a lot of opportunity to continue to make progress on cash as we optimize some of our expenses and turn toward a real focus on Block 2
for the remaining 4 or 5 months of the year .
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Quilty with Quilty Analytics.
Christopher Quilty
So, I noted that in the press release, you mentioned that there is an outlook for larger size government contract awards. And I mean, are we talking kind of
like SIPRs Phase 3 or some OT As or a budget line item in terms of the types of programs that you might be able to participate in?
Scott Wisniewski
Chris, yes, Scott here.
I think all of the above are on the table, Chris, over time, right? The contracts that we announced earlier in the year and then the awards we referenced on
this call, these are all, like I said, early opportunities, small revenue, kind of the SIPR or Phase 1 type of stuf f that you referred to. But as you know , the
intent of programs like that is not to do a science project, but rather to build out a capability .
And so that's what we're referring to in our remarks that initial tests are going well. Other initial contracts awards have been made through our prime
contractor partners. And the outlook for those has improved.
Christopher Quilty
We use cookies on this site to provide a more responsive and personalized service. Continuing to browse, clicking I Agree, or closing this banner

Got you. And mentioning your prime contractors, some of those are involved in the PLEO contract. Is it fair to assume that that could be a potential vehicle
for funding or?
Scott Wisniewski
We don't want to comment on specific programs at this time, Chris.
Christopher Quilty
Also, just back to the ASIC, I mean, is it fair to assume that the ASIC production or , delivery into production is sort of the gating factor for -- scaling up to
the full Block 2 satellites?
Abel Avellan
No, Chris. I mean, the size of the satellite, the 2,400 square feet, the largest size for Block 2 is independent, if they are equipped with FPGA  or ASIC.
We have completed the ASIC tape out.
The first launches will be still on an FPGA  configuration, but we can keep launching on FPGA  for as long as is needed.
So there is not a prerequisite for launches. But of course, we want to incorporate the ASIC as that is a 10x increase in capacity per satellite. And we're
very happy to conclude the tape out. It's -- we received the first dive several weeks back, and we're incorporating into our micron design as we continue to
build the next batch of satellites.
Operator
At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Scott Wisniewski
Thank you, operator . We're building a space-based cellular broadband network designed for the use of the phone in your pocket today , and other
government applications. W e want to thank all of our shareholders and the research analysts for joining the call and everyone's continued strong support
of our mission. And we look forward to the upcoming launch. Thank you.
Operator
And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
