Good
 
day,
 
and
 
thank
 
you
 
for
 
standing
 
by.
 
Welcome
 
to
 
the
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
Fourth
 
Quarter
 
2024
 
Business
 
Update
 
Call.
 
Please
 
be
 
advised
 
that
 
today's
 
conference
 
is
 
being
 
recorded.
 
I
 
would
 
now
 
like
 
to
 
hand
 
the
 
conference
 
over
 
to
 
your

Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
and
 
good
 
afternoon,
 
everyone.
 
Today,
 
I'm
 
also
 
joined
 
by
 
Chairman
 
and
 
CEO,
 
Abel
 
Avellan;
 
and
 
our
 
Chief
 
Financial
 
Oﬃcer,
 
Andrew
 
Johnson.
 
Let
 
me
 
refer
 
you
 
to
 
Slide

of
 
the
 
presentation,
 
which
 
contains
 
our
 
safe
 
harbor
 
disclaimer.
 
During
 
today's
 
call,
 
we
 
may
 
make
 
certain
 
forward-looking
 
statements.
 
These
 
statements
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
current
 
expectations
 
and
 
assumptions
 
and
 
as
 
a
 
result,
 
are
 
subject
 
to
 
risks
 
and
 
uncertainties.
 
Many
 
factors
 
could
 
cause
 
actual
 
events
 
to
 
diﬀer
 
materially
 
from
 
the
 
forward-looking
 
statements
 
on
 
this
 
call.
 
For
 
more
 
information
 
about
 
these
 
risks
 
and
 
uncertainties,

Factors
 
section
 
of
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile's
 
annual
 
report
 
on
 
Form
 
10-K
 
for
 
the
 
year
 
ended
 
December
 
31,
 
2024,
 
with
 
the
 
Securities
 
and
 
Exchange
 
Commission
 
and
 
other
 
documents
 
ﬁled
 
by
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
with
 
the
 
SEC
 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time.
 
Also,
 
after
 
our
 
initial
 
remarks,
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
starting
 
our
 
Q&A
 
section
 
with
 
questions
 
submitted
 
by
 
our
 
shareholders.
 
For
 
those
 
of
 
you
 
who
 
may
 
be
 
new
 
to
 
our
 
company
 
and
 
mission,
 
there
 
are
 
over
 
5
 
billion
 
mobile
 
phones
 
in
 
use
 
today
 
around
 
the
 
world,
 
but
 
many
 
of
 
us
 
still
 
experience
 
gaps
 
in
 
coverage
 
as
 
we
 
live,
 
work
 
and
 
travel.
 
Additionally,
 
there
 
are
 
billions
 
of
 
people
 
without
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
and
 
who
 
remain
 
unconnected
 
to
 
the
 
global
 
economy.
 
The
 
markets
 
we
 
are
 
pursuing
 
are
 
massive,
 
and
 
the
 
problem
 
we
 
are
 
solving
 
is
 
important
 
and
 
touches
 
nearly
 
all
 
of
 
us.
 
In
 
this
 
backdrop,
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
is
 
building
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
and
 
only
 
global
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
network
 
in
 
space
 
to
 
operate
 
directly
 
with
 
everyday
 
unmodiﬁed
 
mobile
 
devices
 
and
 
supported
 
by
 
our
 
extensive
 
IP
 
and
 
patent
 
portfolio.
 
We
 
have
 
made
 
signiﬁcant
 
progress
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
year,
 
and
 
I
 
am
 
excited
 
to
 
pass
 
the
 
call
 
to
 
our
 
Chairman
 
and
 
CEO,
 
Abel
 
Avellan,
 
who
 
will
 
discuss
 
our
 
achievements
 
and
 
our
 
vision
 
going
 
into
 
2025.
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Scott.
 
The
 
past
 
several
 
months
 
have
 
been
 
transformational
 
for
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
and
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
accelerate
 
manufacturing,
 
expand
 
our
 
partner
 
ecosystem
 
and
 
demonstrate
 
unique
 
and
 
diﬀerentiated
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
capabilities.
 
2024
 
was
 
the
 
year
 
we
 
validated
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
position
 
as
 
a
 
technology
 
leader
 
and
 
inventor
 
in
 
this
 
new
 
industry.
 
And
 
in
 
2025,
 
we
 
will
 
leverage
 
this
 
position
 
alongside
 
our
 
expansive
 
IP
 
portfolio
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
3,500
 
patents
 
and
 
patent
 
pending
 
claims,
 
to
 
further
 
enable
 
through
 
space-based
 
connectivity
 
to
 
the
 
device
 
in
 
your
 
pocket
 
today.
 
Simply
 
put,
 
we
 
entered
 
2025
 
with
 
the
 
talent
 
and
 
partners,
 
technology
 
and
 
intellectual
 
property,
 
access
 
to
 
space
 
and
 
spectrum
 
and
 
the
 
funding
 
to
 
move
 
at
 
accelerated
 
pace
 
in
 
this
 
fast
 
developing
 
market.
 
Key
 
pieces
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
are
 
now
 
in
 
place.
 
Our
 
technology
 
has
 
capacity
 
to
 
deliver
 
voice,
 
data,
 
video
 
calls
 
and
 
other
 
native
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
capabilities,
 
making
 
us
 
a
 
truly
 
diﬀerentiated
 
oﬀering
 
for
 
us
 
and
 
our
 
network
 
partners.
 
We're
 
now
 
moving
 
forward
 
to
 
integrate
 
with
 
our
 
partner
 
networks,
 
which
 
will
 
enable
 
initial
 
service
 
with
 
our
 
mobile
 
network
 
operator
 
partners,
 
AT&T
 
and
 
Verizon
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
Vodafone
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
Kingdom
 
and
 
Turkey,
 
and
 
Rakuten
 
in
 
Japan.
 
Our
 
mobile
 
network
 
operator
 
partners
 
include
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
largest
 
telecom
 
operators
 
in
 
the
 
world
 
and
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
partners
 
continue
 
to
 
grow.
 
We
 
now
 
have
 
agreements
 
with
 
approximately
 
50
 
mobile
 
network
 
operators
 
globally,
 
which
 
have
 
nearly
 
3
 
billion
 
existing
 
subscribers
 
around
 
the
 
world.
 
This
 
year
 
is
 
about
 
building
 
our
 
constellation
 
to
 
reach
 
commercial
 
service.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
our
 
technology
 
has
 
been
 
designed
 
from
 
the
 
beginning
 
to
 
support
 
broadband,
 
not
 
just
 
text
 
messaging
 
or
 
emergency
 
SOS,
 
as
 
noted
 
recently
 
by
 
our
 
partners,
 
AT&T,
 
Verizon
 
and
 
Vodafone,
 
who
 
each
 
completed
 
video
 
calls
 
over
 
our
 
in-orbit
 
network.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
capability
 
for
 
voice
 
and
 
data
 
services
 
at
 
broadband
 
speed
 
to
 
modify
 
smartphones.
 
Since
 
our
 
last
 
business
 
update
 
call
 
with
 
investors,
 
we
 
achieved
 
several
 
major
 
milestones.
 
First,
 
we
 
solidiﬁed
 
our
 
balance
 
sheet
 
with
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
ﬁnancing
 
with
 
an
 
attractive
 
structure.
 
And
 
with
 
that,
 
we
 
are
 
accelerating
 
our
 
manufacturing,
 
which
 
I
 
will
 
speak
 
to
 
you
 
shortly.
 
Second,
 
we
 
signed
 
an
 
agreement
 
that
 
once
 
completed,
 
will
 
provide
 
us
 
with
 
the
 
largest
 
block
 
of
 
high-value,
 
lower
 
mid-band
 
spectrum,
 
our
 
making
 
the
 
spectrum
 
owned
 
and
 
operated
 
by
 
our
 
partners.
 
Third,
 
we
 
accelerated
 
satellite
 
manufacturing
 
eﬀort
 
with
 
planning
 
and
 
production
 
of
 
40
 
Block
 
2
 
global
 
satellites
 
underway
 
alongside
 
with
 
additional
 
components
 
and
 
materials
 
needed
 
for
 
over
 
50.
 
Fourth,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
expand
 
our
 
commercial
 
ecosystem,
 
both
 
with
 
MNOs
 
with
 
the
 
Vodafone
 
agreement
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
government
 
contracts.
 
In
 
fact,
 
just
 
this
 
past
 
week,
 
we
 
announced
 
a
 
new
 
$43
 
million
 
contract
 
award
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
Space
 
Development
 
Agency,
 
or
 
SDA.
 
Our
 
recent
 
contract
 
is
 
just
 
for
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
what
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
achieve
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government.
 
And
 
last,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
solidify
 
the
 
regulatory
 
framework
 
for
 
our
 
services
 
with
 
the
 
SEC.
 
Let
 
me
 
brieﬂy
 
elaborate
 
on
 
each
 
of
 
these
 
achievements.
 
We
 
completed
 
$460
 
million
 
convertible
 
senior
 
note
 
oﬀering,
 
resulting
 
in
 
nearly
 
$1
 
billion
 
in
 
cash
 
on
 
our
 
balance
 
sheet.
 
Alongside
 
with
 
this
 
capital
 
raise,
 
we
 
secured
 
cap
 
call
 
transactions,
 
which
 
increased
 
the
 
eﬀective
 
conversion
 
price
 
of
 
the
 
note
 
to
 
approximately
 
$45
 
per
 
share.
 
With
 
a
 
4.25%
 
coupon,
 
we
 
signiﬁcantly
 
reduced
 
our
 
cost
 
of
 
capital
 
for
 
the
 
company.
 
And
 
with
 
the
 
cap
 
call,
 
we
 
minimize
 
eﬀective
 
dilution
 
to
 
existing
 
shareholders
 
to
 
approximately
 
53%
 
at
 
the
 
eﬀective
 
conversion
 
price.
 
Importantly,
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
transaction,
 
AT&T,
 
Google,
 
Verizon
 
and
 
Vodafone
 
converted
 
their
 
existing
 
notes
 
and
 
became
 
Class
 
A
 
common
 
shareholders.
 
We
 
welcome
 
our
 
loyal
 
partners
 
and
 
shareholders,
 
and
 
we
 
appreciate
 
their
 
ongoing
 
support.
 
The
 
ﬁnancing
 
of
 
[Technical
 
Diﬃculty]
 
and
 
our
 
new
 
balance
 
sheet
 
enabled
 
us
 
to
 
immediately
 
and
 
aggressively
 
accelerate
 
our
 
manufacturing
 
plans.
 
We
 
have
 
accelerated
 
the
 
procurement
 
of
 
components
 
and
 
materials
 
needed
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
complete
 
fully
 
fully
 
integrated
 
and
 
assembly
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
have
 
accelerated
 
procurement
 
of
 
components
 
and
 
materials
 
needed
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
complete
 
fully
 
assembled
 
microns,
 
which
 
are
 
the
 
building
 
block
 
power
 
satellites
 
and
 
phased
 
array
 
for
 
over
 
50
 
satellites.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
the
 
assembly
 
stage
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
last
 
steps
 
in
 
the
 
manufacturing
 
process,
 
and
 
we
 
procure
 
long
 
lead
 
items
 
ﬁrst
 
to
 
ensure
 
we
 
remain
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
integration
 
and
 
assemble
 
stages.
 
As
 
part
 
of
 
our
 
accelerating
 
manufacturing,
 
we
 
have
 
increased
 
our
 
global
 
footprint
 
to
 
approximately
 
194,000
 
square
 
feet
 
in
 
Midland.
 
Texas,
 
59,000
 
square
 
feet
 
in
 
Barcelona,
 
Spain
 
and
 
soon
 
85,000
 
additional
 
square
 
feet
 
in
 
Homestead,
 
Florida,
 
respectively.
 
We
 
have
 
completed
 
the
 
bring
 
up
 
and
 
initial
 
validation
 
of
 
our
 
novel
 
ASIC
 
chip,
 
which
 
will
 
support
 
up
 
to
 
10,000
 
megahertz,
 
10
 
gigahertz
 
processing
 
bandwidth
 
per
 
satellite
 
with
 
peak
 
data
 
speed
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
120
 
megabits
 
per
 
second.
 
We
 
expect
 
to
 
incorporate
 
our
 
ASIC
 
into
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellite
 
later
 
this
 
year.
 
We
 
also
 
exercised
 
our
 
contract
 
option
 
for
 
more
 
launches,
 
and
 
now
 
we
 
have
 
fully
 
contracted
 
load
 
capacity
 
for
 
approximately
 
60
 
satellites
 
during
 
2025
 
and
 
2026,
 
which
 
gets
 
us
 
to
 
continue
 
service
 
in
 
U.S.,
 
Europe
 
and
 
Japan
 
and
 
some
 
selected
 
markets
 
outside
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
Next,
 
we
 
signed
 
an
 
agreement,
 
which
 
would
 
provide
 
long-term
 
access
 
to
 
up
 
to
 
45
 
megahertz
 
of
 
lower
 
mid-band
 
spectrum
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
for
 
direct-to-device
 
satellite
 
application.
 
This
 
agreement,
 
when
 
consummated,
 
will
 
augment
 
our
 
capability
 
pairing
 
existing
 
plans
 
for
 
the
 
Continental
 
United
 
States
 
on
 
previous
 
3GPP
 
low-band
 
spectrum
 
in
 
the
 
850
 
megahertz
 
band,
 
which
 
oﬀers
 
superior
 
penetration
 
and
 
coverage
 
characteristics
 
with
 
access
 
to
 
up
 
to
 
45
 
megahertz
 
of
 
lower
 
mid-band
 
spectrum,
 
the
 
largest
 
available
 
block
 
of
 
high-quality
 
nationwide
 
spectrum
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
Spectrum
 
is
 
a
 
scarce
 
resource
 
and
 
our
 
spectrum
 
agreement
 
matches
 
an
 
attractive
 
spectrum
 
position
 
with
 
the
 
largest
 
satellite
 
upgrade
 
for
 
direct-to-device
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
space.
 
The
 
agreement
 
for
 
long-term
 
access
 
to
 
this
 
spectrum
 
enhanced
 
our
 
strategy
 
of
 
working
 
with
 
MNO
 
partners.
 
Our
 
partners
 
dedicate
 
premium
 
low-band
 
spectrum
 
to
 
support
 
our
 
services.
 
The
 
spectrum
 
we
 
are
 
accessing
 
ampliﬁes
 
existing
 
capacity.
 
Speciﬁcally,
 
more
 
spectrum
 
means
 
increased
 
subscriber
 
capacity
 
and
 
better
 
service
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
enable
 
feed
 
data
 
transmission
 
speed
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
120
 
megabits
 
per
 
second
 
for
 
a
 
true
 
broadband
 
experience
 
directed
 
from
 
space
 
to
 
everyday
 
smartphone.
 
This
 
positions
 
us
 
and
 
our
 
mobile
 
network
 
operator
 
partners
 
for
 
signiﬁcant
 
growth
 
while
 
reinforcing
 
our
 
place
 
in
 
the
 
broader
 
wireless
 
ecosystem
 
with
 
a
 
valuable
 
strategic
 
asset.
 
And
 
just
 
recently,
 
we
 
received
 
a
 
special
 
temporary
 
authority
 
STA
 
approval
 
from
 
the
 
FCC
 
to
 
commence
 
testing
 
service
 
with
 
AT&T
 
and
 
Verizon
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
This
 
approval
 
will
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
connect
 
and
 
test
 
our
 
BlueBird
 
satellite
 
with
 
modiﬁed
 
smartphones
 
without
 
the
 
need
 
of
 
any
 
specialized
 
software,
 
device
 
support
 
or
 
updates.
 
The
 
FCC
 
approvals
 
underscore
 
the
 
shared
 
goal
 
between
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
and
 
the
 
commission,
 
and
 
we
 
anticipate
 
additional
 
FCC
 
ruling
 
soon,
 
and
 
we
 
continue
 
integrating
 
our
 
groundbreaking
 
technology
 
with
 
our
 
strategic
 
partners.
 
The
 
ﬁrst
 
5
 
commercial
 
Block
 
1
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
launched
 
in
 
September
 
2024
 
are
 
fully
 
operational.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
our
 
satellite
 
[
 
amasses
 
]
 
each
 
the
 
largest
 
ever
 
commercially
 
deployed
 
communication
 
array
 
below
 
earth
 
orbit
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
international
 
space
 
station.
 
For
 
context,
 
our
 
upcoming
 
Block
 
2
 
satellites
 
are
 
more
 
than
 
3x
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
Block
 
1
 
satellites,
 
measuring
 
approximately
 
2,400
 
square
 
feet.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
we
 
need
 
a
 
much
 
smaller
 
number
 
of
 
satellites
 
compared
 
to
 
traditional
 
operators
 
in
 
the
 
low
 
earth
 
orbit.
 
The
 
size
 
of
 
our
 
satellites
 
accelerate
 
our
 
path
 
to
 
commercial
 
revenues
 
and
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
our
 
satellites
 
and
 
network
 
decrease
 
any
 
single
 
point
 
of
 
failure,
 
reducing
 
our
 
risk
 
proﬁle.
 
I
 
am
 
very
 
pleased
 
to
 
report
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
5
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
are
 
all
 
performing
 
as
 
expected.
 
We
 
have
 
fully
 
tested
 
each
 
satellite
 
and
 
put
 
them
 
into
 
operations.
 
It
 
was
 
exciting
 
to
 
watch
 
Vodafone
 
CEO,
 
Margherita
 
Della
 
Valle,
 
complete
 
a
 
video
 
call
 
using
 
our
 
space-based
 
technology.
 
AT&T
 
and
 
Verizon
 
completed
 
video
 
calls
 
shortly
 
after.
 
This
 
operational
 
milestone
 
demonstrates
 
our
 
unique
 
capabilities
 
that
 
our
 
satellites
 
were
 
designed
 
for,
 
not
 
just
 
text
 
messaging,
 
but
 
full
 
broadband
 
capabilities
 
and
 
other
 
native
 
cellular
 
capabilities
 
to
 
completely
 
unmodiﬁed
 
smartphones.
 
On
 
the
 
government
 
front,
 
we
 
recently
 
secured
 
an
 
additional
 
contract
 
for
 
$43
 
million
 
of
 
revenue
 
with
 
the
 
Space
 
Development
 
Agency
 
through
 
a
 
prime
 
contractor.
 
Scott
 
will
 
provide
 
support
 
details
 
momentarily.
 
But
 
this
 
commercial
 
award
 
highlights
 
the
 
capabilities
 
of
 
our
 
dual-use
 
technology
 
for
 
specialized
 
government
 
applications.
 
Our
 
government
 
contract
 
pipeline
 
continues
 
to
 
show
 
strength,
 
driven
 
by
 
new
 
use
 
cases
 
for
 
our
 
unique
 
technology,
 
which
 
are
 
becoming
 
clearer
 
every
 
day.
 
With
 
our
 
successful
 
initial
 
launch
 
and
 
the
 
progress
 
across
 
manufacturing
 
and
 
our
 
commercial
 
and
 
government
 
agreement,
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
key
 
pieces
 
of
 
operationalizing
 
the
 
restricted
 
mobile
 
network
 
are
 
now
 
in
 
place.
 
I
 
am
 
incredibly
 
proud
 
of
 
the
 
tireless
 
eﬀort
 
from
 
our
 
team
 
and
 
our
 
partners,
 
particularly
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
several
 
months
 
to
 
get
 
us
 
to
 
this
 
critical
 
point.
 
With
 
each
 
step,
 
we
 
move
 
closer
 
to
 
achieving
 
our
 
mission
 
of
 
connecting
 
you
 
connected
 
and
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
bringing
 
you
 
more
 
updates
 
in
 
the
 
months
 
ahead.
 
I
 
will
 
now
 
pass
 
to
 
Scott
 
to
 
provide
 
more
 
details
 
on
 
our
 
commercial
 
progress.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Abel.
 
As
 
Abel
 
mentioned,
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
months
 
have
 
been
 
truly
 
signiﬁcant
 
for
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile.
 
All
 
of
 
the
 
facets
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
are
 
coming
 
together
 
nicely,
 
and
 
we
 
enter
 
2025
 
in
 
our
 
strongest
 
position
 
to
 
date.
 
Let
 
me
 
provide
 
additional
 
details
 
on
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
achievements
 
and
 
what
 
they
 
mean
 
for
 
the
 
commercialization
 
of
 
the
 
company.
 
Just
 
last
 
week,
 
we
 
signed
 
a
 
$43
 
million
 
revenue
 
contract
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Space
 
Development
 
Agency
 
through
 
a
 
prime
 
contractor.
 
This
 
contract
 
follows
 
successful
 
in-orbit
 
testing
 
on
 
our
 
BlueWalker
 
3
 
test
 
satellite
 
under
 
the
 
previous
 
contract
 
announced
 
in
 
February
 
of
 
2024.
 
Importantly,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
prepaid
 
contract,
 
but
 
rather
 
revenue
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
receive
 
and
 
recognize
 
alongside
 
service
 
delivered
 
on
 
our
 
5
 
satellites
 
in
 
orbit
 
and
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites.
 
This
 
contract,
 
as
 
with
 
our
 
other
 
U.S.
 
government
 
contracts
 
to
 
date,
 
serve
 
as
 
an
 
evaluation
 
of
 
our
 
capabilities
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
potential
 
larger
 
long-term
 
contracts.
 
Now
 
taking
 
a
 
step
 
back,
 
this
 
marks
 
our
 
ﬁfth
 
contract
 
award
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government
 
and
 
our
 
third
 
supporting
 
the
 
Space
 
Development
 
Agency.
 
We
 
continue
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
strong
 
demand
 
proﬁle
 
for
 
space
 
applications
 
from
 
the
 
DoD,
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
read
 
about
 
in
 
the
 
press
 
and
 
in
 
particular,
 
for
 
our
 
unique
 
architecture,
 
which
 
facilitates
 
a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of
 
communications
 
and
 
noncommunications
 
applications.
 
Our
 
network
 
is
 
also
 
attractively
 
positioned
 
as
 
dual-use
 
capable,
 
meaning
 
the
 
same
 
spacecraft
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
both
 
consumer
 
and
 
government
 
programs.
 
On
 
the
 
commercial
 
front,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
advance
 
with
 
our
 
partners,
 
including
 
the
 
approximately
 
50
 
mobile
 
network
 
operators
 
we
 
have
 
initial
 
agreements
 
with
 
today.
 
The
 
depth
 
and
 
excitement
 
of
 
these
 
conversations
 
has
 
continued
 
to
 
increase
 
alongside
 
our
 
business
 
milestones
 
like
 
the
 
high-proﬁle
 
video
 
calls
 
with
 
Vodafone,
 
AT&T
 
and
 
Verizon
 
that
 
we
 
recently
 
conducted.
 
During
 
2025,
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
round
 
out
 
our
 
strategic
 
markets
 
with
 
additional
 
MNOs,
 
building
 
out
 
the
 
initial
 
planned
 
coverage
 
footprint
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
Europe,
 
Japan
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government.
 
Additionally,
 
during
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
half
 
of
 
2025,
 
you
 
will
 
begin
 
to
 
see
 
gateway
 
sales
 
or
 
bookings
 
that
 
will
 
bring
 
in
 
cash
 
and
 
revenue
 
during
 
2025
 
and
 
also
 
provide
 
a
 
leading
 
indicator
 
for
 
the
 
markets
 
where
 
you
 
will
 
see
 
initial
 
service
 
revenue.
 
Turning
 
to
 
Vodafone
 
in
 
particular.
 
In
 
December,
 
we
 
ﬁnalized
 
a
 
deﬁnitive
 
long-term
 
commercial
 
agreement
 
for
 
SpaceMobile
 
service
 
through
 
2034.
 
This
 
agreement
 
establishes
 
the
 
framework
 
for
 
Vodafone
 
to
 
oﬀer
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
connectivity
 
in
 
its
 
home
 
markets
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
to
 
other
 
operators
 
via
 
its
 
partner
 
markets
 
program.
 
Our
 
agreement
 
with
 
Vodafone
 
is
 
a
 
culmination
 
of
 
the
 
many
 
years
 
working
 
together
 
to
 
advance
 
connectivity,
 
marking
 
another
 
signiﬁcant
 
step
 
in
 
our
 
historic
 
partnership.
 
And
 
then
 
just
 
yesterday,
 
we
 
announced
 
a
 
further
 
agreement
 
with
 
Vodafone
 
to
 
accelerate
 
the
 
commercialization
 
of
 
the
 
SpaceMobile
 
network
 
across
 
all
 
of
 
Europe.
 
This
 
jointly
 
owned
 
entity
 
will
 
exclusively
 
distribute
 
our
 
space-based
 
cellular
 
broadband
 
service,
 
expanding
 
our
 
addressable
 
market
 
signiﬁcantly
 
in
 
Europe.
 
This
 
means
 
shared
 
ground
 
infrastructure
 
to
 
manage
 
geographic
 
boundaries
 
and
 
turnkey
 
solutions
 
to
 
increase
 
take-up
 
with
 
smaller
 
operators
 
earlier
 
in
 
our
 
deployment.
 
Also
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
our
 
European
 
expansion,
 
we
 
are
 
opening
 
a
 
research
 
and
 
validation
 
hub
 
in
 
Malaga,
 
Spain
 
to
 
support
 
space
 
and
 
land
 
mobile
 
broadband
 
research.
 
This
 
strategic
 
expansion,
 
along
 
with
 
our
 
increased
 
manufacturing
 
footprint
 
in
 
Barcelona,
 
will
 
enhance
 
our
 
capabilities
 
to
 
serve
 
the
 
European
 
market
 
and
 
underscore
 
our
 
long-term
 
commitment
 
to
 
the
 
continent.
 
And
 
with
 
that,
 
I
 
will
 
hand
 
it
 
oﬀ
 
to
 
Andy.
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
Thanks,
 
Scott,
 
and
 
good
 
afternoon,
 
everyone.
 
I
 
echo
 
the
 
sentiment
 
expressed
 
by
 
Abel
 
and
 
Scott.
 
2024
 
was
 
a
 
pivotal
 
year
 
in
 
the
 
history
 
of
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile,
 
and
 
we
 
continued
 
our
 
rapid
 
operating
 
transformation
 
during
 
Q4
 
of
 
2024.
 
Our
 
successful
 
launch
 
of
 
5
 
Block
 
1
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
in
 
September,
 
coupled
 
with
 
our
 
achievement
 
of
 
full
 
operational
 
status
 
of
 
those
 
satellites
 
in
 
early
 
Q4,
 
has
 
positioned
 
us
 
well
 
to
 
continue
 
our
 
intense
 
focus
 
on
 
expanding
 
our
 
customers,
 
both
 
through
 
commercial
 
and
 
U.S.
 
government
 
engagements.
 
As
 
2024
 
came
 
to
 
a
 
close,
 
AST
 
SpaceMobile
 
was
 
a
 
transformed
 
company,
 
poised
 
to
 
lead
 
the
 
burgeoning
 
direct-to-device
 
satellite
 
communication
 
industry.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
ﬁnancial
 
resources
 
to
 
support
 
our
 
bold
 
initiatives
 
to
 
accelerate
 
the
 
manufacturing
 
and
 
deployment
 
of
 
our
 
satellites
 
in
 
an
 
eﬀort
 
to
 
scale
 
our
 
revenue
 
in
 
the
 
coming
 
periods.
 
The
 
start
 
of
 
2025
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
continuation
 
of
 
this
 
signiﬁcant
 
progress.
 
As
 
mentioned
 
earlier,
 
we
 
accelerated
 
satellite
 
manufacturing
 
eﬀorts
 
in
 
line
 
with
 
our
 
plans
 
to
 
launch
 
up
 
to
 
60
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
during
 
2025
 
and
 
2026.
 
We
 
strengthened
 
our
 
balance
 
sheet
 
through
 
our
 
strategic
 
capital
 
raising,
 
facilitating
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
our
 
production
 
targets,
 
including
 
the
 
planning
 
and
 
production
 
of
 
40
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
and
 
fully
 
assembled
 
microns
 
and
 
phased
 
array
 
to
 
support
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
53
 
satellites.
 
Production
 
is
 
well
 
underway
 
at
 
our
 
manufacturing
 
facilities
 
as
 
we
 
expand
 
our
 
footprint
 
globally.
 
Moving
 
to
 
the
 
operating
 
and
 
metrics
 
slide.
 
Let's
 
review
 
the
 
key
 
operating
 
metrics
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
and
 
full
 
year
 
2024.
 
On
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
chart,
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024,
 
we
 
incurred
 
non-GAAP
 
adjusted
 
cash
 
operating
 
expenses
 
of
 
$40.8
 
million
 
versus
 
$45.3
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder,
 
non-GAAP
 
adjusted
 
operating
 
expenses
 
exclude
 
certain
 
noncash
 
operating
 
costs,
 
including
 
depreciation
 
and
 
amortization
 
and
 
stock-based
 
compensation.
 
This
 
quarter-over-quarter
 
decrease
 
resulted
 
from
 
$9.3
 
million
 
of
 
reduced
 
R&D
 
costs
 
primarily
 
related
 
to
 
our
 
now
 
completed
 
ASIC
 
bring-up
 
and
 
initial
 
validation
 
work.
 
partially
 
oﬀset
 
by
 
a
 
$4.2
 
million
 
increase
 
in
 
adjusted
 
engineering
 
services
 
costs
 
and
 
a
 
slight
 
increase
 
of
 
$0.6
 
million
 
in
 
adjusted
 
general
 
and
 
administrative
 
costs
 
in
 
connection
 
with
 
our
 
accelerated
 
plans
 
related
 
to
 
our
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
and
 
investments
 
to
 
bolster
 
our
 
critical
 
commercial
 
and
 
administrative
 
functions.
 
For
 
the
 
full
 
year
 
2024,
 
non-GAAP
 
adjusted
 
cash
 
operating
 
expenses
 
totaled
 
$151.8
 
million
 
compared
 
to
 
$154.6
 
million
 
for
 
the
 
full
 
year
 
2023.
 
Increased
 
engineering
 
services
 
and
 
G&A
 
costs
 
in
 
2024
 
were
 
more
 
than
 
oﬀset
 
by
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
reduction
 
in
 
R&D
 
costs
 
as
 
we
 
reduced
 
third-party
 
research
 
and
 
development
 
eﬀorts
 
and
 
pivoted
 
to
 
our
 
internal
 
engineering
 
and
 
cross-functional
 
administrative
 
support
 
in
 
connection
 
with
 
our
 
satellite
 
manufacturing,
 
deployment,
 
commercial
 
and
 
U.S.
 
government
 
engagement
 
eﬀorts
 
related
 
to
 
our
 
Block
 
1
 
and
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites.
 
Turning
 
towards
 
the
 
second
 
chart
 
on
 
this
 
slide.
 
Our
 
capital
 
expenditures
 
for
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024
 
were
 
approximately
 
$86
 
million
 
versus
 
$26.5
 
million
 
for
 
the
 
third
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024.
 
This
 
ﬁgure
 
is
 
made
 
up
 
of
 
approximately
 
$77
 
million
 
of
 
capitalized
 
direct
 
materials
 
and
 
labor
 
for
 
our
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellites
 
and
 
additional
 
facility
 
and
 
production
 
equipment
 
for
 
our
 
recently
 
expanded
 
194,000
 
square
 
foot
 
assembly,
 
integration
 
and
 
test
 
facilities
 
in
 
Midland,
 
Texas.
 
This
 
amount
 
was
 
just
 
slightly
 
less
 
than
 
our
 
guidance
 
of
 
approximately
 
$100
 
million
 
that
 
I
 
provided
 
on
 
our
 
last
 
business
 
update
 
call
 
in
 
November
 
due
 
to
 
timing
 
of
 
a
 
payment
 
ultimately
 
made
 
in
 
January
 
versus
 
December.
 
Overall,
 
and
 
as
 
expected,
 
capital
 
expenditures
 
have
 
continued
 
to
 
ramp
 
in
 
connection
 
with
 
Block
 
2
 
BlueBird
 
satellite
 
production
 
and
 
related
 
launch
 
commitments.
 
Today,
 
we
 
are
 
executing
 
a
 
plan
 
to
 
increase
 
monthly
 
satellite
 
production
 
to
 
6
 
satellites
 
per
 
month
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025.
 
In
 
connection
 
with
 
scaling
 
manufacturing
 
and
 
continuing
 
payments
 
on
 
our
 
2-year
 
launch
 
campaign,
 
we
 
expect
 
capital
 
expenditures
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
increase
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
prior
 
quarters.
 
We
 
expect
 
CapEx
 
in
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
$150
 
million
 
to
 
$175
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025.
 
Consistent
 
with
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
of
 
2024,
 
we
 
estimate
 
that
 
our
 
adjusted
 
cash
 
operating
 
expenses
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
quarter
 
of
 
2025
 
will
 
come
 
in
 
within
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
$40
 
million
 
to
 
$45
 
million
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
make
 
critical
 
investments
 
across
 
the
 
organization
 
in
 
support
 
of
 
our
 
growth
 
plans.
 
Timing
 
of
 
the
 
changes
 
in
 
our
 
adjusted
 
operating
 
expenditures
 
and
 
capital
 
expenditures,
 
as
 
I've
 
just
 
described,
 
could
 
be
 
delayed
 
or
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
realized
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
factors.
 
And
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
chart
 
on
 
this
 
slide,
 
we
 
ended
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
with
 
$567.5
 
million
 
in
 
cash,
 
up
 
from
 
$518.9
 
million
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
third
 
quarter.
 
Our
 
ability
 
to
 
maintain
 
cash
 
above
 
$500
 
million
 
during
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter
 
despite
 
the
 
increased
 
capital
 
expenditures
 
was
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
our
 
eﬀective
 
and
 
disciplined
 
use
 
of
 
our
 
existing
 
at-the-market
 
facility,
 
or
 
ATM,
 
partially
 
oﬀset
 
by
 
the
 
repayment
 
of
 
our
 
previous
 
senior
 
credit
 
facility
 
that
 
I
 
discussed
 
on
 
our
 
last
 
call.
 
We
 
currently
 
have
 
approximately
 
$66
 
million
 
available
 
on
 
the
 
ATM
 
facility.
 
Our
 
disciplined
 
and
 
eﬀective
 
use
 
of
 
this
 
facility
 
has
 
allowed
 
us
 
to
 
increase
 
liquidity,
 
supplementing
 
our
 
other
 
strategic
 
ﬁnancing
 
initiatives
 
and
 
accelerating
 
future
 
revenue
 
opportunities,
 
positioning
 
us
 
well
 
to
 
move
 
quickly
 
in
 
building
 
and
 
launching
 
our
 
network.
 
As
 
Abel
 
commented
 
earlier,
 
in
 
2025,
 
we
 
further
 
strengthened
 
our
 
cash
 
position
 
through
 
the
 
execution
 
of
 
a
 
7-year
 
$460
 
million
 
convertible
 
senior
 
notes
 
oﬀering
 
on
 
attractive
 
terms,
 
including
 
a
 
capped
 
call
 
that
 
increased
 
the
 
eﬀective
 
conversion
 
price
 
by
 
100%
 
to
 
$44.98
 
per
 
share,
 
thus
 
minimizing
 
dilution
 
considerably
 
to
 
approximately
 
3%.
 
The
 
oﬀering
 
was
 
more
 
than
 
3x
 
oversubscribed,
 
providing
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
expand
 
our
 
investor
 
base
 
to
 
many
 
new
 
long-term
 
holders
 
that
 
believe
 
in
 
our
 
mission
 
and
 
execution
 
plan
 
of
 
connecting
 
the
 
unconnected.
 
Finally,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
make
 
good
 
progress
 
on
 
nondilutive
 
ﬁnancing
 
from
 
quasi-governmental
 
sources
 
of
 
capital
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
having
 
passed
 
key
 
milestones,
 
including
 
transaction
 
committee
 
acceptance.
 
If
 
these
 
applications
 
are
 
successful,
 
we
 
can
 
use
 
the
 
proceeds
 
to
 
source
 
cost-eﬀective
 
long-term
 
debt
 
funding
 
of
 
large
 
projects.
 
In
 
parallel,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
explore
 
ﬁnancing
 
opportunities
 
through
 
both
 
domestic
 
and
 
global
 
development
 
institutions,
 
providing
 
ﬁnancial
 
services
 
to
 
businesses
 
like
 
ours
 
in
 
emerging
 
markets.
 
We
 
will
 
provide
 
updates
 
as
 
appropriate,
 
and
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
partner
 
banks
 
and
 
our
 
advisers
 
to
 
reﬁne
 
our
 
alternatives.
 
With
 
our
 
growing
 
revenue
 
proﬁle
 
and
 
further
 
diversiﬁed
 
capital
 
market
 
access,
 
we
 
are
 
conﬁdent
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
fund
 
our
 
accelerated
 
operational
 
plans
 
with
 
our
 
existing
 
balance
 
sheet,
 
continued
 
focus
 
on
 
nondilutive
 
customer
 
prepayments
 
and
 
prudent
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
ATM
 
facility.
 
We
 
are
 
proud
 
of
 
the
 
progress
 
we
 
made
 
in
 
2024
 
and
 
remain
 
focused
 
on
 
our
 
mission
 
as
 
we
 
continue
 
a
 
fast
 
start
 
to
 
2025.
 
I
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
keeping
 
you
 
updated
 
on
 
our
 
ﬁnancial
 
progress
 
as
 
the
 
year
 
unfolds.
 
And
 
with
 
that,
 
this
 
completes
 
the
 
presentation
 
component
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
update
 
call,
 
and
 
I'll
 
pass
 
it
 
back
 
to
 
Scott.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
Andy.
 
Before
 
we
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
queue
 
of
 
analyst
 
questions,
 
we'd
 
like
 
to
 
address
 
a
 
few
 
of
 
the
 
questions
 
submitted
 
by
 
our
 
investors.
 
Operator,
 
could
 
you
 
please
 
start
 
us
 
oﬀ
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
question?
 
Operator
 
Lee
 
Ben
 
from
 
New
 
Zealand
 
asked,
 
when
 
does
 
ASTS
 
expect
 
to
 
reach
 
the
 
6
 
BlueBird
 
per
 
month
 
manufacturing
 
target?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Great
 
to
 
see
 
questions
 
coming
 
from
 
New
 
Zealand.
 
We
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
40
 
satellites,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
working
 
already
 
on
 
the
 
long
 
lead
 
items
 
and
 
all
 
key
 
parts
 
of
 
our
 
microns,
 
which
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
building
 
block
 
of
 
our
 
satellite,
 
which
 
is
 
53
 
of
 
them.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
by
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
this
 
year,
 
we'll
 
be
 
at
 
a
 
rate
 
of
 
6
 
per
 
month.
 
For
 
that,
 
we
 
had
 
extended
 
our
 
facility
 
in
 
Midland
 
to
 
around
 
190,000
 
square
 
feet
 
of
 
manufacturing.
 
We're
 
adding
 
additional
 
manufacturing
 
facility
 
in
 
the
 
tune
 
of
 
85,000
 
square
 
feet
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
facility
 
in
 
Florida
 
and
 
another
 
50,000
 
square
 
feet
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
facility
 
in
 
Barcelona.
 
Operator
 
Rick
 
from
 
the
 
Netherlands
 
asked,
 
what
 
does
 
the
 
current
 
sats
 
in
 
orbit
 
do
 
for
 
the
 
company
 
besides
 
testing?
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
progress
 
on
 
the
 
defense
 
or
 
governmental
 
part?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes,
 
well,
 
they
 
are
 
fully
 
in
 
operation
 
at
 
this
 
point.
 
We
 
have
 
got
 
them
 
approved
 
to
 
operate
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
under
 
an
 
STA
 
for
 
both
 
testing
 
of
 
AT&T
 
and
 
Verizon.
 
We
 
already
 
have
 
demonstrated
 
full
 
broadband
 
capability
 
in
 
them,
 
including
 
voice,
 
text,
 
data
 
and
 
video
 
calling
 
capabilities
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
in
 
essence
 
become
 
nationwide
 
across
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
obviously,
 
on
 
an
 
intermittent
 
fashion
 
as
 
there
 
are
 
only
 
5
 
that
 
we're
 
building
 
45
 
to
 
60
 
between
 
this
 
year
 
and
 
next
 
year.
 
With
 
that
 
also,
 
the
 
government
 
usage
 
is
 
planned
 
to
 
start.
 
They're
 
starting
 
doing
 
testing
 
on
 
them
 
and
 
recently
 
announced
 
a
 
new
 
program
 
with
 
the
 
government
 
that
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
base
 
of
 
the
 
testing
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
done
 
on
 
BlueWalker
 
3
 
and
 
now
 
on
 
the
 
operational
 
satellites
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
in
 
orbit.
 
We're
 
very
 
bullish
 
about
 
that
 
opportunity
 
and
 
what
 
the
 
government
 
can
 
use
 
with
 
our
 
satellites,
 
which
 
they
 
are
 
using
 
it
 
already
 
with
 
the
 
satellites
 
that
 
are
 
in
 
operation.
 
Operator
 
Andreas
 
from
 
New
 
York.
 
The
 
recently
 
announced
 
launch
 
campaign
 
had
 
agreement
 
with
 
SpaceX,
 
Blue
 
Origin
 
and
 
ISRO.
 
Are
 
you
 
planning
 
to
 
expand
 
beyond
 
those
 
3?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
So
 
as
 
we
 
thought
 
about
 
our
 
launch
 
strategy,
 
we've
 
done
 
a
 
few
 
things
 
on
 
our
 
side
 
to
 
position
 
us
 
for
 
success.
 
One
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
the
 
satellite,
 
it's
 
launch
 
vehicle
 
agnostic.
 
There's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
commonalities
 
in
 
the
 
designs
 
for
 
launch
 
vehicles,
 
and
 
we
 
were
 
careful
 
to
 
design
 
our
 
BlueBird
 
so
 
that
 
they're
 
stackable
 
and
 
conﬁgurable
 
for
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
major
 
launch
 
vehicles.
 
So
 
that
 
was
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
step.
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
step
 
was
 
last
 
year,
 
we
 
did
 
a
 
deep
 
dive
 
on
 
the
 
market,
 
looked
 
at
 
available
 
capacity,
 
and
 
we
 
selected
 
these
 
3
 
suppliers
 
as
 
we've
 
talked
 
about.
 
So
 
those
 
were
 
important
 
early
 
steps
 
that
 
we
 
took.
 
And
 
to
 
your
 
direct
 
question,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
use
 
other
 
launch
 
providers
 
over
 
time,
 
for
 
sure.
 
But
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
capacity
 
we
 
wanted
 
during
 
2025
 
and
 
2026,
 
up
 
to
 
60
 
satellites,
 
as
 
we
 
mentioned
 
on
 
the
 
call
 
earlier,
 
we've
 
actually
 
exercised
 
that
 
option
 
for
 
the
 
full
 
60.
 
We've
 
got
 
that
 
capacity
 
in
 
the
 
2025
 
and
 
2026
 
time
 
frame.
 
And
 
as
 
we
 
build
 
more
 
capacity
 
beyond
 
that,
 
we'll
 
consider
 
all
 
the
 
supply
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
But
 
for
 
us,
 
we
 
like
 
where
 
we
 
ended
 
up,
 
and
 
this
 
gives
 
us
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
ability
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
the
 
60
 
satellite
 
target.
 
Operator
 
Brian
 
from
 
Maryland
 
asks,
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
remaining
 
risks
 
to
 
full
 
authorization
 
from
 
the
 
FCC
 
for
 
operating
 
a
 
commercial
 
constellation?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
As
 
you
 
may
 
have
 
seen,
 
we
 
recently
 
received
 
STA
 
authorization
 
from
 
the
 
FCC
 
to
 
do
 
initial
 
services
 
with
 
our
 
satellites
 
for
 
both
 
Verizon
 
and
 
AT&T,
 
and
 
that
 
was
 
the
 
basis
 
for
 
the
 
video
 
calls
 
we
 
did
 
with
 
them
 
a
 
few
 
weeks
 
ago.
 
We're
 
also
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
stages
 
of
 
the
 
process
 
for
 
a
 
commercial
 
modiﬁcation
 
of
 
our
 
existing
 
commercial
 
license,
 
and
 
that's
 
something
 
that
 
we're
 
working
 
on.
 
Alongside
 
that,
 
we'll
 
be
 
rolling
 
out
 
a
 
beta
 
service
 
that
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
do
 
scale
 
testing
 
and
 
then
 
a
 
paid
 
service
 
will
 
follow
 
thereafter.
 
And
 
with
 
that,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
thank
 
our
 
shareholders
 
for
 
submitting
 
those
 
questions.
 
Operator,
 
let's
 
open
 
the
 
call
 
to
 
analyst
 
questions
 
now.
 
Operator
 
[Operator
 
Instructions]
 
Our
 
ﬁrst
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Griﬃn
 
Boss
 
with
 
B.
 
Riley
 
Securities.
 
Griﬃn
 
Boss
 
So
 
your
 
agreements
 
with
 
the
 
roughly
 
50
 
MNO
 
partners
 
represent
 
3
 
billion
 
subscribers
 
now.
 
How
 
many
 
MNO
 
subscribers
 
could
 
be
 
addressed
 
by
 
this
 
new
 
SATCO
 
joint
 
venture
 
with
 
Vodafone?
 
Or
 
yes,
 
what
 
would
 
be
 
more
 
helpful
 
is
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
rough
 
sense
 
of
 
the
 
incremental
 
number
 
of
 
subscribers
 
this
 
partnership
 
could
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
tap
 
into,
 
given
 
this
 
opens
 
up
 
the
 
entire
 
European
 
market,
 
which
 
I
 
assume
 
likely
 
includes
 
MNOs
 
that
 
you
 
didn't
 
already
 
have
 
MOUs
 
with.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
It's
 
a
 
great
 
question,
 
and
 
it's
 
a
 
key
 
reason
 
why
 
we
 
and
 
Vodafone
 
wanted
 
to
 
put
 
this
 
structure
 
in
 
place.
 
So
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
full
 
set
 
of
 
connections
 
in
 
Europe,
 
you
 
get
 
to
 
about
 
600
 
plus
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
all
 
the
 
European
 
countries
 
together.
 
And
 
we
 
were
 
only
 
covering
 
before
 
the
 
Vodafone
 
10
 
home
 
market.
 
So
 
this
 
does
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
things.
 
One,
 
it
 
sets
 
a
 
plan
 
for
 
gateways
 
across
 
the
 
continent
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to,
 
despite
 
smaller
 
country
 
sizes,
 
manage
 
orders
 
quite
 
well
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
provide
 
an
 
eﬃcient
 
path
 
to
 
bringing
 
on
 
new
 
countries
 
that
 
we
 
hadn't
 
originally
 
contemplated
 
and
 
more
 
MNOs
 
in
 
each
 
country.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
big
 
step
 
up
 
in
 
that
 
regard,
 
going
 
from
 
just
 
10
 
countries
 
to
 
probably
 
3x
 
that,
 
although
 
certainly,
 
we
 
had
 
good
 
countries
 
covered
 
in
 
the
 
beginning,
 
but
 
this
 
adds
 
some
 
really
 
signiﬁcant
 
countries
 
and
 
some
 
signiﬁcant
 
operator
 
potential
 
for
 
us.
 
And
 
we
 
think
 
that
 
having
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
European-based
 
European
 
sovereign
 
operator
 
is
 
really
 
important.
 
It's
 
important
 
for
 
Europe.
 
It's
 
important
 
for
 
European
 
operators.
 
And
 
it's
 
frankly,
 
an
 
extension
 
of
 
how
 
we
 
built
 
our
 
network,
 
right?
 
We
 
built
 
it
 
so
 
that
 
operators
 
and
 
regulators
 
can
 
feel
 
comfortable
 
about
 
how
 
the
 
traﬃc
 
is
 
managed,
 
and
 
we
 
think
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
extension
 
of
 
that.
 
Griﬃn
 
Boss
 
That's
 
great
 
context.
 
And
 
then
 
next
 
for
 
me,
 
it's
 
related,
 
but
 
well,
 
not
 
related
 
to
 
that,
 
but
 
a
 
2-part
 
question,
 
both
 
are
 
related.
 
First
 
is
 
this
 
$43
 
million
 
contract
 
with
 
the
 
STA.
 
It's
 
great
 
to
 
see.
 
Yes,
 
is
 
this
 
for
 
noncommunication
 
applications
 
and
 
services
 
that
 
you've
 
mentioned
 
for
 
some
 
time
 
now
 
and
 
discussed
 
in
 
the
 
prepared
 
remarks?
 
And
 
then
 
second,
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
question,
 
are
 
you
 
able
 
to
 
provide
 
more
 
detail
 
as
 
to
 
what
 
these
 
noncommunications
 
applications
 
are
 
that
 
your
 
architecture
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
support?
 
Are
 
we
 
talking
 
missile
 
tracking,
 
PNT,
 
remote
 
sensing?
 
Any
 
color
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
provide
 
to
 
us,
 
I
 
think,
 
would
 
be
 
helpful.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
So
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
capability
 
that
 
we're
 
bringing
 
to
 
bear,
 
it's
 
noncommunications
 
like
 
we
 
said,
 
and
 
we
 
won't
 
oﬀer
 
more
 
deﬁnition
 
of
 
that
 
at
 
this
 
time.
 
But
 
it's
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
frequencies
 
that
 
we
 
operate.
 
And
 
so
 
that's
 
what
 
the
 
satellite
 
can
 
do,
 
but
 
we'll
 
say
 
it's
 
noncommunications.
 
And
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
opportunity,
 
yes,
 
this
 
is
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
second
 
phase
 
for
 
the
 
contract
 
that
 
we
 
announced
 
last
 
February
 
and
 
that
 
we've
 
earned
 
revenue
 
against
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
satellite.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
$43
 
million
 
that
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
earn
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
months
 
or
 
so
 
oﬀ
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
5
 
commercial
 
satellites
 
and
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
Block
 
2
 
satellites.
 
And
 
importantly,
 
this
 
is
 
just
 
another
 
further
 
evaluation.
 
So
 
the
 
opportunity,
 
we
 
believe,
 
to
 
be
 
quite
 
large,
 
small
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
total
 
opportunity.
 
And
 
it's
 
one
 
that
 
we're
 
very
 
excited
 
about.
 
And
 
like
 
we
 
said,
 
that's
 
a
 
general
 
time
 
frame
 
and
 
the
 
satellites
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
execute
 
on
 
the
 
milestones
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
$43
 
million
 
of
 
revenue.
 
Griﬃn
 
Boss
 
Okay.
 
And
 
so
 
should
 
we
 
expect
 
that
 
to
 
be
 
linearly
 
recognized
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
months?
 
Or
 
are
 
you
 
providing
 
some
 
services
 
now
 
that
 
might
 
be
 
more
 
robust
 
in,
 
say,
 
6
 
months?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
There
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
slight
 
lag
 
in
 
getting
 
going
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
couple
 
of
 
months,
 
but
 
generally
 
speaking,
 
linear
 
is
 
the
 
right
 
way
 
to
 
model
 
it.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Chris
 
Schoell
 
with
 
UBS.
 
Christopher
 
Schoell
 
We
 
saw
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
buzz
 
with
 
T-Mobile
 
and
 
Starlink's
 
recent
 
launch
 
of
 
its
 
data
 
messaging
 
service.
 
Can
 
you
 
just
 
remind
 
us
 
how
 
your
 
technology
 
diﬀers
 
versus
 
what
 
T-Mobile
 
and
 
Starlink
 
are
 
bringing
 
to
 
market
 
and
 
the
 
advantages
 
you
 
have?
 
And
 
I
 
appreciate
 
their
 
service
 
is
 
just
 
messaging
 
to
 
start.
 
But
 
given
 
the
 
price
 
points
 
they
 
put
 
out
 
there,
 
how
 
does
 
this
 
inﬂuence
 
your
 
own
 
pricing
 
strategy
 
as
 
you
 
ready
 
a
 
full
 
voice
 
and
 
broadband
 
product?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Well,
 
I
 
think
 
that,
 
that
 
is
 
a
 
reﬂection
 
of
 
what
 
I
 
said
 
pricing
 
is
 
for
 
which
 
in
 
essence,
 
is
 
now
 
still
 
quasi
 
intermittent
 
just
 
messaging
 
service.
 
Our
 
services,
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
is
 
voice,
 
text,
 
data,
 
Internet,
 
video,
 
everything
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
on
 
your
 
phone
 
normally,
 
you
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
through
 
our
 
system.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
diﬀerentiated
 
package,
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
oﬀer
 
to
 
the
 
operators.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
our
 
scale,
 
the
 
reason
 
why
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
10,000
 
megahertz
 
of
 
spectrum
 
per
 
satellite
 
that
 
translate
 
to
 
10
 
gigahertz
 
of
 
spectrum
 
per
 
satellite,
 
120
 
megabits
 
per
 
second
 
data
 
rate
 
directly
 
to
 
your
 
phone
 
without
 
requiring
 
any
 
change
 
on
 
the
 
phone
 
or
 
adaptation
 
into
 
the
 
phone
 
using
 
premium
 
existing
 
850
 
megahertz
 
band
 
is
 
greatly
 
diﬀerentiated
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
allow
 
our
 
partner
 
operator
 
to
 
diﬀerentiate
 
with
 
much
 
better
 
service
 
and
 
packages
 
that
 
basically
 
enable
 
the
 
consumer
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
full
 
ﬂedged
 
connectivity
 
when
 
they
 
get
 
access
 
to
 
our
 
service.
 
Christopher
 
Schoell
 
Got
 
it.
 
And
 
then
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
ﬁt
 
one
 
more
 
in
 
on
 
funding.
 
I
 
see
 
the
 
language
 
in
 
the
 
10-K
 
indicating
 
you
 
have
 
funding
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
months
 
with
 
the
 
ATM.
 
I
 
appreciate
 
there
 
are
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
moving
 
pieces.
 
But
 
as
 
you
 
look
 
to
 
2026
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
launch
 
the
 
60
 
satellites,
 
any
 
help
 
sizing
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
capital
 
you
 
think
 
you
 
still
 
need
 
to
 
raise
 
and
 
how
 
you
 
evaluate
 
the
 
diﬀerent
 
sources?
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
As
 
we
 
said
 
both
 
in
 
our
 
statements
 
in
 
the
 
K,
 
we're
 
well
 
positioned
 
to
 
get
 
kind
 
of
 
that
 
ﬁrst
 
threshold
 
of
 
25
 
satellites,
 
which
 
starts
 
a
 
service
 
and
 
well
 
beyond
 
that.
 
It
 
is
 
the
 
case
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
60
 
satellites
 
under
 
our
 
launch
 
campaign,
 
and
 
we
 
feel
 
very
 
good
 
about
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
manufacture
 
the
 
40
 
that
 
are
 
in
 
process
 
right
 
now.
 
We're
 
well
 
positioned
 
for
 
the
 
near
 
term.
 
We're
 
always
 
looking
 
for
 
smart
 
capital
 
raising
 
opportunities,
 
and
 
we'll
 
continue
 
to
 
evaluate
 
them.
 
But
 
with
 
a
 
pro
 
forma
 
balance
 
sheet
 
of
 
about
 
$1
 
billion,
 
we're
 
absolutely
 
positioned
 
in
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
way
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
months.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
with
 
Deutsche
 
Bank.
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
few,
 
if
 
I
 
could.
 
I
 
guess,
 
ﬁrst,
 
on
 
launches,
 
are
 
you
 
still
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
an
 
April
 
launch
 
of
 
the
 
next
 
satellite?
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
what
 
you
 
said.
 
And
 
can
 
you
 
give
 
us
 
any
 
rough
 
sense
 
for
 
the
 
pacing
 
you
 
expect
 
for
 
launches
 
in
 
'25
 
and
 
'26?
 
Just
 
roughly
 
how
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
up
 
to
 
60
 
would
 
you
 
expect
 
to
 
launch
 
this
 
year
 
versus
 
next
 
year?
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
question
 
about
 
cost
 
per
 
satellite,
 
if
 
that's
 
changed
 
at
 
all
 
or
 
if
 
it's
 
still
 
the
 
$19
 
million
 
to
 
$21
 
million
 
per
 
satellite?
 
And
 
then
 
the
 
last
 
thing
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
about
 
was
 
sort
 
of
 
following
 
up
 
on
 
that
 
funding
 
topic
 
from
 
the
 
last
 
question.
 
We
 
get
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
questions
 
regarding
 
how
 
much
 
funding
 
you'll
 
need
 
to
 
fund
 
the
 
business
 
plan
 
and
 
get
 
to
 
free
 
cash
 
ﬂow
 
positive.
 
But
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
the
 
more
 
funding
 
you
 
have
 
available,
 
the
 
wider
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
business
 
plan
 
becomes
 
and
 
the
 
faster
 
you
 
accelerate
 
the
 
business
 
plan.
 
So
 
it's
 
not
 
really
 
about
 
how
 
much
 
you
 
need,
 
but
 
it's
 
more
 
about
 
how
 
much
 
you
 
can
 
raise
 
on
 
attractive
 
terms
 
and
 
invest
 
at
 
an
 
attractive
 
return.
 
Is
 
that
 
the
 
right
 
way
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
it?
 
And
 
anything
 
you'd
 
elaborate
 
on
 
there
 
from
 
a
 
funding
 
perspective?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
Yes,
 
Brian,
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
it
 
is
 
when
 
we
 
combine
 
the
 
noncommunication
 
application
 
[
 
Goldman
 
]
 
base
 
and
 
the
 
communications
 
for
 
consumers,
 
we
 
get
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
start
 
monetizing,
 
as
 
you
 
see
 
in
 
the
 
recent
 
order,
 
not
 
only
 
by
 
a
 
constellation,
 
but
 
on
 
a
 
per
 
satellite
 
basis.
 
So
 
the
 
last
 
guidance
 
that
 
we
 
gave
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
believe
 
to
 
be
 
cash
 
ﬂow
 
positive
 
with
 
around
 
25
 
satellites.
 
It's
 
not
 
that
 
we
 
get
 
to
 
continue
 
service
 
with
 
our
 
25
 
satellites,
 
but
 
with
 
25
 
satellites,
 
we
 
start
 
getting
 
enough
 
applications
 
that
 
are
 
noncommunications
 
combined
 
with
 
some
 
other
 
sources
 
of
 
revenue
 
like
 
gateways
 
and
 
infrastructure
 
built
 
up
 
that
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
cash
 
ﬂow
 
positive.
 
With
 
that,
 
we
 
have
 
greatly
 
accelerated
 
our
 
pace
 
of
 
production.
 
As
 
Andy
 
indicated,
 
we
 
closed
 
the
 
year,
 
we
 
entered
 
into
 
the
 
year
 
with
 
around
 
$1
 
billion
 
in
 
cash
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
basically
 
putting
 
into
 
work
 
into
 
upgrading
 
our
 
capacity
 
of
 
building
 
up
 
to
 
6
 
satellites
 
a
 
month,
 
which
 
will
 
translate
 
to
 
roughly
 
some
 
0.72
 
per
 
year,
 
and
 
we
 
need
 
45
 
to
 
60
 
to
 
get
 
continued
 
service
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
So
 
that's
 
how
 
we
 
are
 
basically
 
planning
 
our
 
network
 
buildup
 
is
 
basically
 
start
 
to
 
get
 
ﬁnanced
 
with
 
revenue
 
rather
 
than
 
equity
 
or
 
other
 
type
 
of
 
transactions.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
launch,
 
we
 
have
 
secured
 
60
 
launches,
 
60
 
satellites
 
to
 
be
 
launched,
 
which
 
we
 
put
 
well
 
in
 
our
 
target
 
in
 
obtaining
 
continued
 
service
 
in
 
U.S.,
 
Europe,
 
Japan
 
and
 
some
 
selected
 
markets.
 
when
 
we
 
call
 
selected
 
markets,
 
basically
 
countries
 
where
 
there
 
are
 
customers
 
that
 
are
 
getting
 
getting
 
to
 
pay
 
early
 
access
 
to
 
our
 
constellation,
 
and
 
that's
 
another
 
source
 
of
 
revenue
 
that
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
utilizing
 
going
 
forward.
 
With
 
the
 
New
 
Glenn,
 
we
 
can
 
launch
 
up
 
to
 
8
 
satellites
 
per
 
launch
 
that
 
pretty
 
much
 
double
 
the
 
cadence
 
of
 
what
 
is
 
possible
 
with
 
the
 
Falcon
 
9.
 
And
 
we
 
expect
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
year
 
to
 
start
 
moving
 
to
 
a
 
launch
 
cadence
 
of
 
around
 
1
 
launch
 
every
 
45
 
days
 
on
 
the
 
new
 
Glenn.
 
We
 
have
 
other
 
launches
 
also
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
secured
 
in
 
advance
 
to
 
that.
 
And
 
so
 
we
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
40.
 
We
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
long
 
lead
 
items
 
of
 
53,
 
and
 
that
 
will
 
dictate
 
the
 
cadence
 
of
 
how
 
we
 
get
 
them
 
into
 
space.
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
And
 
anything
 
on
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
satellite?
 
Has
 
that
 
changed
 
at
 
all?
 
Or
 
are
 
you
 
still
 
in
 
that
 
$19
 
million
 
to
 
$21
 
million
 
range?
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
No.
 
Yes,
 
we're
 
not
 
changing
 
the
 
guidance
 
on
 
cost
 
per
 
satellite.
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
if
 
I
 
could
 
just
 
follow
 
up
 
just
 
on
 
funding.
 
So
 
you
 
still
 
expect
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
free
 
cash
 
ﬂow
 
positive
 
at
 
25
 
satellites.
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
I
 
understand
 
that
 
right?
 
Or
 
does
 
the
 
acceleration
 
sort
 
of
 
modify
 
that
 
time
 
line?
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
No,
 
this
 
is
 
Andy.
 
The
 
only
 
qualiﬁer
 
I'd
 
add
 
is
 
on
 
an
 
operating
 
basis,
 
we
 
see
 
that
 
we'll
 
generate
 
free
 
cash
 
ﬂow
 
at
 
that
 
basis.
 
So
 
obviously,
 
CapEx
 
ﬂexes.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
ramp
 
up
 
and
 
we
 
may
 
dial
 
back
 
depending
 
on
 
needs
 
at
 
a
 
point
 
in
 
time
 
and
 
when
 
launch
 
commitments
 
are
 
made.
 
But
 
on
 
an
 
actual
 
operating
 
basis,
 
yes,
 
as
 
Abel
 
explained,
 
we
 
believe
 
that
 
the
 
25
 
satellites,
 
our
 
applications
 
and
 
opportunities
 
are
 
suﬃcient
 
to
 
generate
 
free
 
cash
 
ﬂow.
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
but
 
just
 
the
 
last,
 
I
 
guess,
 
follow-up
 
to
 
that
 
would
 
then
 
be
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
understand,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
be
 
free
 
cash
 
ﬂow
 
positive,
 
roughly
 
25
 
satellites,
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
the
 
$500
 
million
 
in
 
quasi-government
 
funding
 
that
 
you're
 
pursuing.
 
And
 
I
 
understand
 
it's
 
attractive
 
money.
 
Is
 
that
 
more
 
to
 
reﬁnance?
 
Or
 
do
 
you
 
need
 
that
 
money
 
for
 
other
 
operational
 
purposes?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
This
 
is
 
Scott.
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
long-term
 
strategy
 
of
 
our
 
funding
 
plan,
 
and
 
it's
 
an
 
attractive
 
way
 
that
 
companies
 
like
 
us
 
get
 
funding.
 
And
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
that
 
while
 
we
 
do
 
have
 
diverse
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
capital
 
markets,
 
this
 
is
 
another
 
one
 
to
 
open
 
up.
 
So
 
we've
 
been
 
very
 
prudent
 
and
 
conservative
 
with
 
funding
 
over
 
the
 
life
 
of
 
the
 
company,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
pocket
 
of
 
capital
 
to
 
have
 
available,
 
and
 
we'll
 
assess
 
our
 
cash
 
needs
 
when
 
it
 
becomes
 
available.
 
That
 
particular
 
funding
 
source
 
is
 
a
 
process,
 
Bryan,
 
and
 
it's
 
one
 
we're
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
of.
 
And
 
we'll
 
assess
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
that
 
and
 
when
 
to
 
use
 
that
 
when
 
the
 
time
 
is
 
right.
 
But
 
for
 
us,
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
seen
 
beneﬁts
 
of
 
having
 
good
 
liquidity
 
for
 
the
 
company
 
that
 
we've
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
generate
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
6
 
months,
 
and
 
we
 
like
 
having
 
that
 
backdrop
 
a
 
lot.
 
Bryan
 
Kraft
 
Are
 
those
 
quasi-government
 
sources,
 
are
 
those
 
more
 
like
 
a
 
facility
 
that
 
once
 
you
 
have
 
it,
 
you
 
can
 
draw
 
on
 
it
 
and
 
not
 
pay
 
interest
 
on
 
the
 
whole
 
thing?
 
Or
 
is
 
it
 
once
 
you
 
get
 
it,
 
you
 
get
 
it
 
and
 
now
 
you've
 
got
 
this
 
pile
 
of
 
cash
 
that
 
you've
 
got
 
to
 
service
 
the
 
debt
 
on?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
We're
 
pursuing
 
at
 
least
 
3
 
seriously
 
at
 
the
 
moment
 
and
 
diﬀerent
 
facilities
 
have
 
diﬀerent
 
structures.
 
But
 
yes,
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
of
 
them
 
does
 
have
 
a
 
structure
 
that's
 
delayed
 
draw,
 
like
 
you
 
said,
 
or
 
milestone-based.
 
although
 
we're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
cheap,
 
penny-wise,
 
pound
 
foolish
 
on
 
cost
 
of
 
capital.
 
The
 
key
 
is
 
to
 
maintain
 
the
 
liquidity
 
for
 
the
 
company.
 
But
 
you're
 
right,
 
with
 
the
 
backdrop
 
that
 
I
 
described,
 
having
 
some
 
sort
 
of
 
delayed
 
draw
 
component
 
could
 
be
 
very
 
useful.
 
And
 
in
 
fact,
 
that's
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
ways
 
that
 
we
 
thought
 
about
 
the
 
ﬁnancing
 
for
 
our
 
recent
 
spectrum
 
deal.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
with
 
Cantor.
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
Maybe
 
starting
 
oﬀ,
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
talk
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
the
 
organizational
 
structure
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
chipset
 
engineering
 
team
 
and
 
maybe
 
reﬂect
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
or
 
talk
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
how
 
that
 
chipset
 
team
 
is
 
working
 
with
 
folks
 
either
 
at
 
more
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
handset
 
OE
 
level
 
or
 
even
 
to
 
the
 
higher
 
levels
 
of
 
Vodafone,
 
Google
 
and
 
the
 
like.
 
Abel
 
Avellan
 
I
 
think
 
one
 
clariﬁcation.
 
Our
 
ASIC
 
platform,
 
it
 
is
 
required
 
or
 
used
 
on
 
the
 
satellites
 
only.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
require
 
new
 
chipsets
 
on
 
the
 
handsets.
 
So
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
organized
 
ourselves,
 
we
 
start
 
launching
 
satellites
 
using
 
FPGAs,
 
basically
 
ﬁeld
 
programmable
 
gate
 
arrays.
 
Now
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
completed
 
the
 
ASIC,
 
we're
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
packaging
 
and
 
start
 
incorporating
 
them
 
into
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
this
 
year.
 
So
 
[indiscernible]
 
chip,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
10
 
gigahertz
 
processing
 
capacity,
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
advanced
 
nodes
 
that
 
exists
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
today
 
and
 
certainly
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
advanced
 
in
 
the
 
space.
 
But
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
make
 
clear
 
that
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
require
 
any
 
modiﬁcation
 
of
 
the
 
chipsets
 
on
 
the
 
phones.
 
Our
 
system,
 
it
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
the
 
phone
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
in
 
your
 
pocket
 
without
 
modifying
 
anything
 
on
 
it.
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
Yes.
 
Fully
 
understood
 
on
 
the
 
satellite
 
chip
 
being
 
big,
 
just
 
making
 
sure
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
understood
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
signals
 
and
 
frequency
 
teaming
 
between
 
OEs
 
and
 
AST.
 
As
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
non-GAAP
 
OpEx
 
progression
 
through
 
the
 
year,
 
can
 
you
 
just
 
maybe
 
talk
 
about
 
how
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
current
 
guide
 
and
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
step-up
 
through
 
the
 
year
 
and
 
where
 
you
 
expect
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
growth
 
through
 
the
 
year
 
to
 
progress?
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Andy?
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
I
 
think
 
on
 
the
 
cost
 
growth
 
this
 
year,
 
we'll
 
be
 
talking
 
each
 
quarter
 
about
 
CapEx.
 
But
 
I
 
mean,
 
our
 
CapEx
 
is
 
growth
 
based.
 
It's
 
based
 
on
 
ramping
 
up
 
the
 
40-plus
 
satellites.
 
We
 
obviously
 
have
 
40
 
in
 
production
 
and
 
long
 
lead
 
items,
 
microns
 
for
 
53.
 
That
 
will
 
ﬂex.
 
We
 
started
 
taking
 
that
 
on,
 
and
 
that
 
sort
 
of
 
feeds
 
into
 
that
 
guidance
 
I
 
gave
 
on
 
a
 
ramp-up
 
of
 
CapEx
 
in
 
Q1.
 
Otherwise,
 
I
 
mean,
 
we
 
gave
 
guidance
 
consistent
 
with
 
our
 
OpEx
 
that
 
sort
 
of
 
falls
 
in
 
line
 
for
 
the
 
most
 
part
 
with
 
Q4.
 
Our
 
ASIC
 
costs
 
will
 
come
 
down
 
as
 
we
 
ﬁnish
 
that
 
work
 
and
 
begin
 
to
 
fully
 
integrate.
 
But
 
we'll
 
make
 
additional
 
investments.
 
We're
 
becoming
 
a
 
commercial
 
enterprise
 
now.
 
We're
 
building
 
out
 
that
 
muscle.
 
We
 
are
 
investing
 
in
 
administrative
 
functions
 
across
 
the
 
organization
 
as
 
we
 
grow
 
and
 
prepare
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
full
 
operating
 
company.
 
So
 
you're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
any
 
incredible
 
diﬀerence
 
if
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
past
 
prior
 
periods
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
how
 
we're
 
thinking
 
about
 
operating
 
expense.
 
But
 
at
 
this
 
point,
 
we'll
 
come
 
to
 
you
 
quarterly,
 
which
 
we
 
have
 
and
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
view
 
on
 
going
 
forward.
 
And
 
clearly,
 
I
 
mentioned
 
this
 
in
 
my
 
remarks,
 
but
 
it's
 
probably
 
worth
 
restating.
 
The
 
opportunity
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
really
 
bring
 
cost
 
down
 
is
 
in
 
our
 
R&D
 
function,
 
which
 
in
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
ways
 
was
 
primarily
 
based
 
on
 
third-party
 
expense.
 
That
 
work
 
has
 
been
 
done.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
satellite
 
that
 
is
 
fully
 
developed
 
and
 
engineered
 
now,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
moving
 
to
 
a
 
full-on
 
production
 
environment.
 
And
 
you'll
 
see
 
investments
 
in
 
manufacturing.
 
As
 
Abel
 
mentioned
 
in
 
his
 
remarks,
 
we've
 
added
 
space
 
in
 
Midland,
 
Texas.
 
We've
 
added
 
space
 
in
 
Barcelona,
 
and
 
we're
 
very
 
excited
 
to
 
add
 
manufacturing
 
space
 
in
 
the
 
very
 
near
 
term
 
in
 
Southern
 
Florida.
 
So
 
you'll
 
see
 
those
 
sorts
 
of
 
investments
 
all
 
feeding
 
into
 
becoming
 
a
 
scaling
 
manufacturing
 
company
 
that
 
optimizes
 
satellite
 
production
 
at
 
about
 
6
 
per
 
month
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
Got
 
it.
 
And
 
then
 
maybe
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
on
 
the
 
European
 
opportunity.
 
It
 
seems
 
like
 
the
 
high-level
 
structure
 
of
 
[
 
Iris
 
]
 
is
 
looking
 
to
 
track
 
towards
 
something
 
like
 
STA,
 
where
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
upfront
 
and
 
aspirations
 
for
 
large
 
leveraging
 
of,
 
we'll
 
say,
 
kind
 
of
 
more
 
prime
 
type
 
acquisition
 
approaches.
 
But
 
as
 
we've
 
seen
 
from
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
development
 
on
 
kind
 
of
 
for
 
the
 
U.S.
 
side,
 
it's
 
clear
 
that
 
there's
 
obviously
 
opportunities
 
for
 
services
 
growth,
 
right,
 
the
 
$43
 
million
 
that
 
AST
 
has
 
won.
 
So
 
maybe
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
structure
 
of
 
AST,
 
how
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
your
 
ability
 
to
 
win
 
contracts
 
like
 
the
 
$43
 
million
 
from
 
STA
 
and
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
rev
 
rec
 
that
 
we
 
should
 
expect,
 
whether
 
it's
 
more
 
cost
 
or
 
fee
 
and
 
kind
 
of
 
service
 
delivery-based
 
approaches?
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
Sure.
 
I'll
 
take
 
that
 
one,
 
Colin.
 
First,
 
just
 
on
 
rev
 
rec.
 
This
 
is
 
milestone-based
 
given
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
kind
 
of
 
technology
 
evaluation.
 
And
 
so
 
there
 
are
 
reports,
 
tests,
 
activities
 
we'll
 
be
 
doing
 
with
 
the
 
satellites
 
in
 
orbit,
 
and
 
that
 
will
 
drive
 
that
 
revenue
 
rec
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
months,
 
plus
 
or
 
minus
 
that
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
earlier.
 
And
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
structure
 
of
 
how
 
these
 
contracts
 
will
 
look
 
as
 
they
 
scale,
 
the
 
U.S.
 
government
 
and
 
how
 
they're
 
thinking
 
about
 
buying
 
defense
 
stuﬀ
 
and
 
how
 
they're
 
thinking
 
about
 
space
 
evolves
 
and
 
has
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
diﬀerent
 
elements
 
to
 
it.
 
But
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
we
 
think
 
we're
 
really
 
well
 
positioned
 
for
 
all
 
pieces
 
of
 
that.
 
We
 
function
 
well
 
in
 
the
 
desire
 
to
 
have
 
kind
 
of
 
ﬁrm
 
ﬁxed
 
price
 
and
 
deliver
 
in
 
an
 
environment
 
where
 
you're
 
buying
 
something,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
cost
 
is
 
and
 
that's
 
delivered
 
by
 
the
 
supplier.
 
We
 
don't
 
work
 
on
 
cost-plus
 
contracts.
 
So
 
that's
 
a
 
positive
 
dynamic.
 
And
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
service
 
versus
 
hardware
 
sales,
 
we
 
tend
 
to
 
fall
 
on
 
the
 
service
 
side
 
with
 
how
 
we've
 
built
 
our
 
satellites
 
and
 
how
 
their
 
dual
 
use
 
as
 
we've
 
discussed.
 
But
 
we're
 
open
 
to
 
the
 
mission,
 
and
 
we
 
evaluate
 
and
 
they
 
evaluate
 
diﬀerent
 
ways
 
to
 
structure
 
deals.
 
For
 
us,
 
it's
 
important
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
return
 
on
 
the
 
investment
 
that
 
we've
 
put
 
in
 
place
 
in
 
our
 
network,
 
and
 
we
 
can
 
be
 
ﬂexible
 
on
 
that.
 
But
 
we
 
tend
 
to
 
fall
 
on
 
the
 
service
 
side
 
more
 
than
 
on
 
the
 
hardware
 
sale,
 
obviously.
 
Colin
 
Canﬁeld
 
Right.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
last
 
one
 
for
 
me,
 
maybe
 
latest
 
and
 
greatest
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
kind
 
of
 
expectations
 
around
 
Ligado
 
deal
 
closing,
 
whether
 
it's
 
tracking
 
core
 
ﬁlings
 
or
 
kind
 
of
 
where
 
you
 
expect
 
the
 
next
 
piece
 
of
 
information
 
to
 
come
 
out?
 
Andrew
 
Johnson
 
Yes,
 
this
 
is
 
Andy
 
again.
 
On
 
the
 
Ligado
 
deal,
 
things
 
are
 
tracking
 
nicely.
 
We
 
had
 
publicly
 
disclosed
 
the
 
main
 
tenets
 
of
 
that
 
deal
 
when
 
we
 
signed
 
our
 
binding
 
term
 
sheet.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
work
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
where
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
to
 
complete
 
the
 
deal,
 
but
 
we
 
are
 
well
 
within
 
the
 
time
 
frame
 
that
 
the
 
parties
 
have
 
set
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
with
 
the
 
bankruptcy
 
proceedings,
 
that
 
all
 
needs
 
to
 
play
 
out.
 
But
 
we're
 
working
 
hard
 
on
 
that.
 
We've
 
talked
 
a
 
lot
 
about
 
it.
 
It's
 
a
 
strategic
 
initiative
 
for
 
us,
 
and
 
we're
 
making
 
good
 
progress.
 
Operator
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
reached
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
question-and-answer
 
session.
 
And
 
I'll
 
now
 
turn
 
the
 
call
 
back
 
over
 
to
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
for
 
closing
 
comments.
 
Scott
 
Wisniewski
 
Thank
 
you,
 
operator.
